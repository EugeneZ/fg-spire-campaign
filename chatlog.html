<font color="#7CED7C">GM: (POLL) Ready?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">The city of Spire is rotting from within and with out. Each year the structures built onto the outside of &#10;the city&#8217;s structure collapse and fall away. The cursed &#10;tear in reality, the Heart, festers deep within the cen tre. Disorder and chaos are a natural part of daily life &#10;for those on the edges of civilisation.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">And yet: the brutal undercity of Red Row is more &#10;chaotic than ever. Where before gangs would pass &#10;each other with holstered weapons and wary glances, &#10;each keeping to their respective territories, now they &#10;engage in open warfare, and spireblack gunsmoke &#10;floats through the dark city. Families come apart, &#10;leaving children without mothers, begging on the &#10;streets for sustenance. The Crimson Vigil, a group of &#10;violent anti-aelfir reactionaries, are openly recruiting &#10;soldiers for their forbidden cult. And a new play, The &#10;Weeping Maiden, is touring the district &#8211; and that&#8217;s all &#10;anyone seems to talk about.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Things are coming apart, and ordinary people &#10;are getting caught in the middle. Someone is behind &#10;this. And the ministry has tasked you with getting to the bottom of it...</font><br />
<font color="#000000">You find yourself in a seedy, nameless coffee shop (read: Root) where Scolexis works.</font><br />

<font color="#000000">Scolexis gingerly sips from a steaming mug.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis and then rails it.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis wipes their mouth on a half-rolled sleeve, but neglects the streaks that have already dribbled down their neck in haste.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis vibrates silently behind the counter.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn is seen outside the shop smilling and chatting with some fans</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn She signs the only thing they have available, their clothing. After excusing herself she walks inside.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis leans forward on the counter, noticing Glayjia coming into the shop; they wear their best &#34;service smile&#34; in silent greeting.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis enters the shop, stumbling up to the counter.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn walks up to the counter and smiles</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis sweats.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Your minestry contact, Greb Alladout, proprietor of the shop, puts up a wooden sign with the word CLOSED sctawled on it, kicks a few spasming druggies off the curb, and closes the door. He nods at you three and heads into the back.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn sees Zilvice walk in and smiles.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn: Zilvice! What a pleasure!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn: It's been too long</font><br />

<font color="#000000">Scolexis points at their nametag.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis: We'll show 'em, don't you worry. *To Scolexis* Yeah, who're you?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (trying it out again): J-just your average anarchist.</font><br />

<font color="#005500">GM: Reposting intro</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The city of Spire is rotting from within and with out. Each year the structures built onto the outside of &#10;the city&#8217;s structure collapse and fall away. The cursed &#10;tear in reality, the Heart, festers deep within the cen tre. Disorder and chaos are a natural part of daily life &#10;for those on the edges of civilisation.&#10;And yet: the brutal undercity of Red Row is more &#10;chaotic than ever. Where before gangs would pass &#10;each other with holstered weapons and wary glances, &#10;each keeping to their respective territories, now they &#10;engage in open warfare, and spireblack gunsmoke &#10;floats through the dark city. Families come apart, &#10;leaving children without mothers, begging on the &#10;streets for sustenance. The Crimson Vigil, a group of &#10;violent anti-aelfir reactionaries, are openly recruiting &#10;soldiers for their forbidden cult. And a new play, The &#10;Weeping Maiden, is touring the district &#8211; and that&#8217;s all &#10;anyone seems to talk about.&#10;Things are coming apart, and ordinary people &#10;are getting caught in the middle. Someone is behind &#10;this. The player characters, all of them noted profes sionals in Red Row (and relative novices in the Min istry) gather their resistance cell together and start &#10;investigating.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (lamely): ...Am I right? Comrades?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis winks conspiratorially.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Holding up a fist: That's right comrade</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: well, I guess I am..</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (bowing): nice too meet you comrads</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis squees silently that *the* Glayjia is a comrade.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (holding up a fist): That's right... Comrade.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: So we are to investigate who is stirring up chaos down here?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I think a good place to start is with The Crimson Vigil</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (motioning after Greb): I suppose that's what he'll tell us...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis claps their hands together.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Shall I make us beverages?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis is actually already pouring themself another cup.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (With hesitation): I've never had this beverage.. What is it?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Greb has already left. He assumes you know what you're doing. He's merely arranging the meeting space.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Our special &#34;Red Row Roast&#34;! A robust, city-style blend made with the finest rejected beans from the pier.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis slumps slightly.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...They say you can't drink it without Dagger, but I disagree.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...You get used to it eventually.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis sips.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: hmmm well, very well I'll give it a try. Then, I suggest we head out.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Sure sure, I'll take one too.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Today's entry in the Spire Compendium...... Dagger: A lucky-dip of drugs, veering towards grimy &#10;stimulants, sold throughout Red Row. A pouch of &#10;dagger &#8211; it&#8217;s sold as a brownish, crystalline dust &#8211; &#10;could contain upwards of forty individual chemi cals, depending on how many hands it has passed &#10;through before it ends up travelling up someone&#8217;s &#10;nose. Users commonly get into a lot of fights, and &#10;have a hugely over-inflated belief in their own &#10;combat abilities when they do</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis beams and empties the beat-up carafe into a pair of paper to-go cups made out of newsprint. They tuck a tin cup filled with rough Dagger crystals and a spoon under their arm while clutching the cups together.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Okay, let's go!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis goes downstairs.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Scolexis): *goes out back.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: without Dagger please</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: follows</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (lifting cup): To Spire, may she soon be out of filthy Aelfir control</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Outside, the sights and.... smells.... of Red Row await. Voices and violence echo through the sparse, cavern-like atmosphere. Business are operating. Money is changing hands. Druggies wander the streets, begging money from teenagers carrying swagger sticks.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (toasting): To our spire and the downfall of the Aelfir rule</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (toasting): Uh... hear hear!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis chugs.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: Drinks</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis slips the can of Dagger into their apron pocket.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis frowns that their going out doing Ministry business in their work uniform.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Sigh.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Scolexis): *they're</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (grimicing): My goodness! Acidic, charcoal heavy flavor.. Not for me</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Greb would call it &#34;Bracing.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: So, we can start with these Crimson vigil folks or start by just talking with the towns folk</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (slams the cup and wipes his mouth): Well, I say we start with The Vigil. Shall we?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis twirls a lock of hair between their fingers in thought, trying to remember if they've overheard anything from the cafe recently.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (stealthily spills out her mug): very well</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Scolexis): The pavement lightly sizzles beneath the pool of Red Row Roast.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis recalls that several &#34;customers&#34; spoke recently about a Crimsonite handing out fliers at the Arena. They were offended that when they asked for a flier, the woman handing them out looked them up and down, sniffed, and refused to give them a flyer.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis raises a finger with a silent &#34;A-ha!&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I think I have an inkling of where we might start the investigation.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis studies Zilvice.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hm...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: And just the person to push to the fore.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Very good! Onwards!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: To the Arena!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You follow the smell of blood to Arena, where round-the-clock fights are taking place. There are a handful of informal fighting &#34;pits&#34; (really just throngs of people throwing down money). Arena is built into a large step-well, so to enter one must pass through some arches at the top of the step-well. The entrance is guarded by several thuggish characters who eye you warily as you approach.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis winces slightly, thinking that they may have miscalculated.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The thugs do not look like crimsonites. Red Row is generally &#34;guarded&#34; by one of three gangs.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn approaches the thugish group</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Good day to you all. I was wondering if any of you have seen anyone handing out fliers?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (awed): So bold!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis gathers their resolve and sidles in.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [3d10 = 16]<br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (chimes in): We wanted to post some up at the cafe, if you could please, please help us out...! We would be very grateful!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis takes their can of Dagger out of their apron and shakes it back and forth.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Thug: I told your friend, no solicitatin'!And I'll tell you the same. You wanna bet on fights, get inside. You wanna fight, get inside. You wanna hand out parchment, this ain't the place for you. Your friend said something about going to the House 'o Slop to get a bite.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Sounds...nice. Thank you</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn turns around and leaves for the House 'o Slop</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis frowns slightly and shakes an impotent fist at the House of Slop.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis catches themself and thanks the thug while bowing.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis turns heel and skitters after Glayjia.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The House of Slop -- you have probably been here before. It exists primarily to quench the flames and passions built up by Arena and as such is mostly built out of rock and cement -- easier to clean. The building consists of a counter where you can order food -- the only access to the staff is through a thin slit through which money cna be passed. Once your food emerges from a similar slot on the other side, you are encouraged to take it to one of the many cavern-like rooms that dot the establishment. There is no waitstaff.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You find a woman outside the entrance who holds a stack of leaflets. She holds them in one hand while idly glancing around the street. When she sees you, she holds up a flier and beckons you over.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (mutters): I always envied their ethical treatment of &#34;the help&#34;.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn walks over to the woman</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Greatings!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (approaches the woman): What'ya got?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis remains a distance away, but within earshot.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: You there! Do you hate the aelfir scum? Of course you do! Take one of these, meet me tonight at ratcatch station. Give 'em to your friends!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn takes a flier</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Thank you friend. Down with the aelfir indeed.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The flier says &#34;DO  NOT FORGET LEKOLE. SHE HAS NOT FORGOTTEN YOU. FOR VENGEANCE AGAINST OPPRESSORS, MEET AT RATCATCH. BRING A CLOAK AND A SHARP KNIFE.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There is a picture of a towering figure, with many limbs, silently glowering at you. It looks rather terrifying.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Rather bold to be recruiting like this innit? Not really &#34;cloak and dagger&#34; is it?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (snatches pamphlet): Amatuer</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Well, It looks like i'll need a cloak. A dagger, I already have.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d10 = 2]<br />
<font color="#261A12">The woman quickly snatches a knife from her belt and grabs Zilviceby the throat, spinning him around and slamming him into the wall of the Slop House. She puts the knife to his chest. &#34;Did I ask for opinions?&#34; she spits</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (gruffly): No, but you seem like you could use the advice...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: We are after all after the same thing... The end of Aelfir rule</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (quickly steps in before Zilvice is murdered): Please we are after the same goal.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Crimsonite lets Zilvice slide to the floor.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis 's eyes begin darting around nervously, wondering if they're making too much of a scene.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: I've had enough of this shit. Here, you pass these fuckin' things out.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Crimsonite hands you the stack, turns around and starts to walk away, swearing under her breath.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis blinks.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Have... you just gotten recruited?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (dusting himself off as he gets up): It would seem so.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: 'All Praise to the Blood-Moon', I guess.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Unfortunately our lead just stormed off though... Should we follow her?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis throws up their hands into an incredulous shrug.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well... She kind of already spilled the beans, didn't she?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: On the other hand, now that we have the flyers... I guess we can sorta sabotage the meet-up with a bunch of silly misinformation.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Turn it into a 'punch and pie' sort of thing. Sing-along janboree.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Scolexis): *jamboree.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (mind wandering): Hmm... punch and pie...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis nods along</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Something like that, yea</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Good idea</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Shall we alter these fliers?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis pulls out a marker from their apron.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Let's.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Suggest we change them to seem like the crimson are against the popular play Weeping Maiden</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis taps their chin thoughtfully.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So... add an ad onto the flyer?</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Scolexis): Sorry, disregard what they said, I read Glayjia's dialogue wrong.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hmm... &#34;Weeping Maiden naut'shinder&#34;?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: &#34;Lekol&#233; does not approve&#34;?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis goes ahead and defaces a number of the flyers, crossing out &#34;cloak&#34; and &#34;sharp knife&#34; with &#34;punch&#34; and &#34;pie&#34;.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Could you enlighten me as to these odd words you use?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Eigh, some old grandma words for &#34;forbidden&#34; or some such.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I figured that some orthodox Lekolites would get the message.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis frowns slightly, wondering if their efforts might backfire and make the Crimsonites more popular with the youth.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: i guess do what you will... I feel like this has gotten out of hand a bit</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Or I simply do not understand your message</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: In the best case scenario we have Crimsonites barging in on performances of the Weeping Maiden and we kill two birds with one stone.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: In the worst... we confuse and inconvenience some people.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Do what you will to the flier. I just know we need to be at that meeting to hear what they are recruiting for.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Yes, I agree with Zilvice.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis tries to imagine what could be important about Ratcatch station.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d10 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">Crimsonite: </font> [d3 = 1]<br />
<font color="#261A12">A lot of the denizens of red row throw strange glances at Scolexis when he attempts to hand out the fliers. It seems that it takes a certain.... attitude to successfully market to the Red Row crowd. Eventually, a frustrated arena combatant flips his lid upon seeing the drawing on the flyers, grabs the stack from Scolexis, and sets them afire in front of you. The whole operation does not reflect well upon your reputation.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis tries to smile through the embarrassment.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (through tears): I choose to see this as a victory.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis poses.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: That's a good attitude. but it doesn't look like you're taking it well.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (weakly): I am okay.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (is): screaming inside.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis is screaming inside.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Well, to a chop to pick up three robes and two daggers?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (dejectedly): 'Kay.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (nodding): 'sgo</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You pick up some generic robes and daggers. It was disturbingly cheap and easy. The hardest part was convincing the vendor you wanted the weapon, not the drug.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Onto the meetup</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis puts up their hood, still slightly traumatized from earlier.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Scolexis): tfw you get ratioed on Drow TikTok</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis knows the location of many Vermissian stations, including Ratcatch and guides you to it. When you arrive, you find the station empty. The Crimsonite said to arrive &#34;tonight&#34; which is largely a meaningless statement in the Underspire, but perhaps you have beaten everyone, including the organizers, to the punch. The station itself is a monument to a richer time for the underspire. Dusty murals line the walls, their subject matter graffitied over with gang signs. Statues of ancient heroes stand armless, headless, and occasionally with a tentacle or two that they likely did not originally possess. The place hums with an ethereal energy. As is often the case near the Vermission, you get the feeling that you are not alone.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis sighs slightly, feeling better in a more familiar surrounding.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn Looks around supiciously</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Anyone else getting a bad feeling?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (oblivious): Not particularly.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (shouting): Hello?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn looks around for clues to see if anyone had been here recently</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis goes off on their own to admire the handiwork of their forebears.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">A voice calls out from the darkness. You turn to look and see no one.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: Welcome to Ratcatch, novices.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: You are early. That demonstrates excitement. Hunger. It is well.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis stops where they are. They look about, trying to find a direction to the voice.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You believe the voice is coming from across the tracks. It is very dark there, where the light from the fires does not reach.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I do have a hunger. A need to bring about the downfall of the aelf</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: Tsk tsk. You must learn patience, young one. And discretion. The aelfir is a cunning enemy. Do not speak aloud your goals. We know why you are here.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (warily): Why don't you come out so we can speak easier?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: You speak wisely and similar to what Zilvice said earlier</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis leans towards the darkness trying to see the speaker</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: Soon we shall teach you the ways of Lekole. How to hide in the darkness, yes, but also more fearsome things. We will teach you the power of vengeance. It is not the time to question me, novice. Do you wish to join our order? Do you wish to give yourself to our Mother, vengeful Lekole?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Yes, let my new mother Lekole guide me</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (stammering): Um-mum-um... Vengeance for the Blood-Moon.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks to Glayjia, then toward the darkness with an affirmative nod.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (bowing head slightly): Of course, I shall not question your authority again. Please welcome us to your ranks.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [3d10 = 10]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: +2</font> [3d10+2 = 30]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [2d10 = 11]<br />
<font color="#660066">Crimsonite: </font> [d6 = 4]<br />
<font color="#660066">Crimsonite: </font> [d10 = 3]<br />
<font color="#261A12">There is a pause in the darkness as the Crimsonite takes this in. The Vermissian station hums in the background.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: You shall enter our order, and soon. Lekole has a task for you. Find an aelfir, or anyone else that you would name opressor, and destroy them. By any means necessary. Lekole guide your hand! We will know when the deed is done, for it shall be in Lekole's name.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: We shall do as you and Lekole demand and thank you for your guidance.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis raises their hand.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Ah, um, excuse me! May I ask a question?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: You may.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Um, in the Blood-Moon's name... Um, is it one murder each, or can this be a group assignment?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: Only he whose hand guides the blade (metaphorically speaking, of course) shall be acting as Lekole would. It is noble to help someone else in an act of vengeance, but it is not enough to join our order.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Aw, jeeze... Well, may Mother Lekol&#233; guide my blade!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: Indeed.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You feel that whatever presence was there, it is now gone</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I... guess we can go now?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: To kill an aelfir?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Isn't that every day?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis taps their chin absent-mindedly.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis takes one last good look of the ceiling of the station before making for the exit.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn follows</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (once back outside): So, who to kill..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The ceiling was one of the only surfaces in the station safe from graffiti. Gazing up at it, Scolexis sees a strange symbol, a depiction of a flowery dragon, wrapping itself around all the columns of the station before finally circling around and eating its own tail. Scolexis could wswear they can see the scales of the dragon glimmer.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: See, with this whole recruitment drive means that it's open season on Aelfir and that means we're competing against any number of Vigilites.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis smiled at the sight of the dragon before leaving the station, having now gotten over their infamy with the flyers. For now.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Should we... I dunno. Keep casing this place and size up the competition? So we know who we're up against in this great Aelfir hunt?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: What, try and find some other underground societies?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis shakes their head.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: That may be a good idea... At least we will know how many others showed.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: No, I mean stick around and see who else is interested because of the flyers and stuff.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...And maybe snipe their victims before they get the chance.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: ah I see. Or, we can just kill the first Aelfir that looks at us wrong?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Or expose them to keep recruitment down.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks aghast.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Y-y-y-you mean narc on fellow drow?! To *them*?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: They would do you just the same. Or worse</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis fidgets.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: H-how do you guys feel about seeing a play...?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (knowing what play is being referenced): Firstly, it's not a very good play, and secondly how does that help us?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: It's just another thing we're supposed to investigate, right?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Besides... who knows if we'll trip over some sort of slumming Aelfir in a box seat.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Sure, and there may be Aelfir in attendance</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (Sighing): very well.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (pointing to his nose then at Scolexis): Same</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Maybe we should still see how this meeting turns out. Thoughts?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis sighs slightly.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well, we are here already.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Sure</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks about for a concealed vantage.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2d10 = 11]<br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: hides in the shadow and searches</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [3d10 = 7]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [3d10 = 21]<br />
<font color="#000066">Crimsonite: You finding appropriate hiding spots, with Scolexis successfully identifying several good hiding places thanks to having looked the place over before. Soon enough, others wander into the station. They arrive in clumps, much like you did. They go through a similar process, except, they, perhaps more gung-ho than you. Mostly, the recruits appear to be the down-trodden --- those who have had enough. By that measure, you're surprised there aren't more. Regardless, after overhearing some juicy details, you are about to consider leaving when Glayjia is spotted by a roving Crimsonite.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">The Crimsonite chases you out of Ratcatch. It's not clear to you how much, if at all, your cover is compromised. But it's probably best to be careful!</font><br />

<font color="#005500">GM: Glayjia is WATCHED until session 3a </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You overhear one particular target -- a dark elf who was abused by an Aelfir with some sick tastes. He occassionally comes to pay a visit to the Red Row Children's Orphanage, ostensibly to be seen bestowing large monetary gifts to &#34;the poors&#34; but the new recruit avered that he overstays his welcome and darker acts occur when the crowds melt away. A tempting target....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">His name is Drawn-Cloud-Over-High-Seas-Sparkling.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Less a murder, more of a community service.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">The revolutionaries met up at Scolexis's workplace: A coffee-house (read: drug den). There, some of them met each other for the first time, and others had already previously known of each other. Now they have agreed to work together. They have heard about unrest in Red Row. A madness is upon the beasts of the land, metaphorically speaking. Something is afoot -- the violence in Red Row is worse than usual. The Crimson Vigil terrorist group is openly recruiting. Gangs that were previously in an uneasy peace are openly fighting, and the police that was already sparse in Red Row is stretched to the breaking point. And yet, all anyone can talk about is that damn play, The Weeping Maiden. The Ministry wants an investigation.&#10;Scolexis, Glayjia, and Zilvice decide to begin by investigating the Crimson Vigil. On a rumor, they visit Arena, where they are told that the sect's representative has now moved across the street to a slophouse. They find the woman, but Zilvice provokes her and her temper flares. She throws Zilvice into a wall, then storms off, leaving them with the flyers. The flyers are advertising a recruitment meeting for the Crimson Vigil in Ratcatch, a station of the Vermissian. After a failed attempt to modify the flyers and ruin the Vigil's party (or improve it, really), the group heads directly to the meet.&#10;At Ratcatch, they are met by a hidden leader of one of the Crimson Vigil cells. He remains in darkness as he attempts to recruit the group. They successfully fool him into believing them to be raw recruits, and he tells them that to join they must please Lekole, and to please Lekole they must each destroy an oppressor. After he leaves, the Ministers decide to hide and wait for others in order to collect more intel. They do manage to learn about a potential target: child-molester Drawn-Cloud-Over-High-Seas-Sparkling. He visits the orphanage in Red Row regularly, ostensibly to be seen &#34;giving back to the community.&#34; (However, Glayjia is almost caught. Did they get a good look at her?)</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Begin Session 1b</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So... Maybe we should head back to the Row? We might be able to get more leads on the way to the orphanage.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Onwards!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis nods</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You arrive back at Red Row. It is much as you left it.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis frowns slightlty, trying to imagine what could possibly be at Wyld's Georama.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (without context): Maybe it's full of wild, untamed rocks!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis glances about the Row, looking for signs of a Weeping Maiden show nearby. Or anywhere.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: looks for children</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2d10 = 8]<br />
<font color="#660066">GM: </font> [d3 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d3 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis soon stumbles into a a family of four who appear to be on their way to a performance. They are costumed up for the occassion, wearing bits of aluminum foil in place of what must be jewelery, and raggedy coats painted with regal colors. The children whoop and scream, skipping towards a local alehouse. You follow in their wake and arrive for a performance of The Weeping Maiden. There is a mix of every possible type of person in attendance. Three aelfir huddle around a table, their guard retinue working hard to keep the audience away. Their expressions are unreadble through their masks but you sense excitement. Drow, humans, and even a few gnolls are squeezed into the public area, staring towards the &#34;stage,&#34; which is really just a section near the fire cordoned off by chairs. There six figures stand with their backs turned. Some members of the audience make hushing noises.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (quietly): We may as well see what all the hubbub is about...?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: ug. If you wish to loose your hearing then so be it.. I shall bear this for awhile</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (awkwardly): 'Kay.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis weaves their way toward the counter to buy a drink to cover their attendance.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I'll take anything with caffeine!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The bar service is badly backed up.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (frowns,): but remains in queue. They nervously glance at the performance, hoping to absorb anything from where they are.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis frowns, but remains in queue. They nervously glance at the performance, hoping to absorb anything from where they are.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: throws a few copper on the ground to get the croud to desperse so she can get drinks</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: Asks the bartender for a coffee, an ale, and a gin please</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Here Scolexis, your coffee. Zilvice, I take you for an Ale man.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (awed): Star power...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Close that Jaw honey. You haven't seen anything yet. That was just taking advantage of the needy.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Sounds about right</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis sips their coffee.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis tries to get closer to the performance.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (Puts on his masters mask and approaches the aelfir. Reckognizing the masks he bows and says): Good evening to you all.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The aelfir note the mask and guardedly nod back. One whispers something to another. They turn back to the stage.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: My apologies for bothering you. I was wondering if my friends and I would be able to sit with you for the show? It is so terrible having to be associated with these... Others</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Servant To The High Ones</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [4d10 = 23]<br />
<font color="#261A12">The aelfir stare at you and look like they want to refuse but cannot find a a good excuse to do so. They glance at each other, each hoping the others would think of something. After the silence gets long enough to get akward, Zilvice clears his throat and the aelfir immediately purr &#34;Why of course. This is the corner for the more... refined. Such as yourself. *giggle*&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (nods his head): Thank you.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis waves over his companions</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis shuffles on over, keeping their gaze toward the floor. They can feel their work uniform constricting around their chest.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: joins Zilvice. She bows to her hosts</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I am Glayjia Baylorn and I thank you for allowing my friends and I to join you.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The aelfir refuse to acknowledge Scolexis and Glayjia at all. Sweat begins to bead around the edges of their masks.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (subtly clears throat): Glayjia is a revered performer but sometimes forgets her place... What are our names masters, so that I may pass along to Qinrel that you have accommodated us so?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Wolf-Mask-Aelfir: I am Joy-Becoming-Dark-Drawings. This is Louder-Chasms-Beat-Paths-Under and of course, the beautiful Clear-Flake-Of-Grass.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Wolf-Mask-Aelfir: We are pleased to make your aquiantance.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Likewise</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis says nothing and tries to hyper-focus on the play.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis pats Glayjia on the shoulder and settles in to watch the play.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: seething with anger she decides to watch the play</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Soon, the crowd sushes itself (mostly) and the torch lights grow dimmer as if in anticipation. A drummer begins to methodically beat a drum. One of the performers turns. She wears flowing lace and bright bands of jewelery and a thin crown befitting a drow princess. She bows, then walks in a circle, showing off for the crowd before settling at one end of the &#34;stage.&#34; The drum beat changes to a more aggressive, almost grating beat, and another of the performers turns. He wears a ducal chain made of fake gold and backflips into the opposite corner of hte stage. The drums beat furiously and the crowd cheers in anticipation. The two performers charge at each other, with the duke throwing a punch and ducking at the same time. His punch naiuls the princess in the jaw and she drops to the floor. The audience gasps!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Another of the performers startles and taps the rest on the shoulder. Two of them engage the duke as the audience cheers him on. The third drags the princess away from the center of the stage.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis also gasps</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The two engaging the duke &#34;punish&#34; the duke by throwing him into the crowd, who cheer and toss the duke back. On his way back he throws a kick at one of the rescuers.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">At some point, the princess revives and the sixth performer leaves her and jumps between the duke and the fighting knights. She is dressed in purple, red, and black, and has a mask that covers her face and reveals only two glowing eyes. She stops the duke and the knights by sweeping them off their feet. The performers all get up and bow. Act 1 is complete.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: crosses her arms and scoffs quitely</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis amid the commotion leans to Glayjia</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (motions slightly towards Louder-Chasms and whispers): That's our guy. No guard</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (whispers): I see. Should we do him at the end of the second act and walk away? it will look like he is sleeping</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Perhaps after the show. No witnesses</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: very well</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The second act continues similarly to the first, except now when someone loses a fight, a small gnoll runs out with a rope and ties the &#34;dead&#34; performer to the rafters by their arms and drapes a colorful shawl over them. You eventually start to piece together that the princess is murdering the duke's friends or acquintenaces for vengeance.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis starts to wonder if this is a fanciful historical drama.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The act ends with the &#34;murder&#34; of the duke, followed by a gyrating, spasmy dance performance by the princess where she is tossed between the hanging performers before finally collapsing to the ground. She flips her mask around to reveal two glowing eyes and the drums pound in anticipation! The crowd is ecstatic. You feel a strnage energy pulsing thyrough the room.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Your thoughts keep wandering back to the deep ideas presented by the performance while you await the third act. This seems a life-changing experience to you. You are tempted to abandon your plans of resistance and instead go tell more people about this fantastic play. You hope they can pull off the ending!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis blinks and shakes their head, remembering that they're supposed to real-pretend-murder an aelfir because reasons.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: scoffs</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis they look to Glayjia and Zilvice, wondering if they've been struck with similar thoughts.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: wants to murder more Aelfir</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis sips their coffee.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (Whispers): How can people like this..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: What a fantastic performance, right?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Kinda envy how... &#34;contagious&#34; it is?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Or is &#34;infectious&#34; a better word?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: The actors are doing marvelous. I'm just not a fan of the script.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis looks to the Aelfir at the table to see their reactions</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The aelfir are doing their best to maintain their composure. They do, however, pound the table heavily to show their appreciation. One has taken off a golden bangle, which they clearly plan to throw at the performers during the finale.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis thinks hard about what must be the kind of magic involved in this play to affect the audience so.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The third act is a culmination of the first two. The five performers, having climbed down from the rafters and rubbed the blood back into their limbs, put on masks of innocent-looking animals. They have a grand melee that involves the audience throwing things at them as they fight each other. They all get pummelled to bits, though you pick up on the general story being that the godess has the last word on the vengeful princess and that her vengeance ends up taking the lives of all those around her, foes and family alike. Darkness descends upon the land via the shawls being thrown into the fire, snuffing it out and darkening the room. The applause and screams can be heard for a long time. The performers bow, except one of the knights, who's leg appears broken and is helped backstage by a gnoll.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2d10 = 7]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Trying to think about the magic involved in the play results in falling prey to its magic, to a degree.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis winces a little and downs the rest of their coffee.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis begins to consider theatre as a &#34;Plan B&#34; career option.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (out loud, to no one): Maybe one day I'll make it to grip!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The performance is over. The actors accept the applause with grace.... but also are careful to quickly grab any money or trinkets.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis joins in the applause</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn does applaudes the actors a bit but doesn't want to applaude much.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis claps politely, but with the added reservation of knowing that there was magic afoot.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (whispers): How do we take care of the other two with our target?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (to the Aelfir): What a show! Fantastic!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Wolf-Mask-Aelfir: Yes, isn't it wonderful? Sometimes the low arts can be quite beautiful! What a performance. I thought the script quite ingeneius.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Quite ingenious indeed!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Unfortunate now we must go our seperate ways... </font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (feigning concerned): Oh but Master Louder-Chasms-Beat-Paths-Under you seem to be unaccompanied. Would you be so kind as to let us escort you home? It is terribly rough in these streets, especially after an event such as this.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Clear-Flake (surprised): Oh!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Clear-Flake (grips Louder-Chasm's hand): We thought we might spend... but.... well....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: It is the least we could do after you showing us such kindness to let us sit with you.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [4d10 = 15]<br />
<font color="#000066">Louder-Chasm: But -- well -- it is so nice of you to offer. We shall play together another night, my sweet.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Louder-Chasm: Shall we depart soon, then? It is quite tiresome to wait around for the portlift if it gets late. I shall wait for you to say farewell to your.... friends...?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn stands up and walks to the entrence awaiting her companions</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis follows Glayjia, eyes cast downward.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: You can call them that, yes. Whenever you are ready, we will go. Best to get a jump on the crowds.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis bows and extends his arm showing the way towards the door.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">GLAMOUR. Black magic and poise let you become &#10;whoever they want you to be. Once per situation, &#10;choose an NPC. Using a cocktail of charm, prac ticed poise and semi-legal black magic, you change &#10;your appearance to represent their ideal partner. &#10;You don&#8217;t get to determine what this looks like &#8211; &#10;it&#8217;s entirely reliant on the person you&#8217;re targeting &#10;&#8211; and you can end the spell by scrubbing off what ever makeup you&#8217;ve applied and spending five &#10;minutes in front of a mirror remembering what &#10;you look like.&#10;Whatever your target prefers, you&#8217;ll always look &#10;like you. If they&#8217;re obsessed with tall people, you&#8217;ll &#10;look taller; if they like aelfir, you&#8217;ll look as though &#10;there&#8217;s some aelfir blood in you; if they&#8217;re mad &#10;about one particular person, you&#8217;ll resemble them &#10;(but not enough to, say, pass as them).</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice and Louder-Chasm proceed away from the pub and towards the docks. Zilvice looks for a suitable alley to duck into. Meanwhile, Glayjia follows behind, stealthily. Scolexis takes the lead.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [d10 = 9]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2d10 = 12]<br />
<font color="#660066">Louder-Chasm: </font> [d3 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [3d10 = 9]<br />
<font color="#660066">Louder-Chasm: </font> [d3 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d10 = 5]<br />
<font color="#000066">Louder-Chasm: It was so nice of you to offer to escort me. Coming down here is always such a risk. *giggle* I will be sure to let Qinrel know how much I appreciate her staff. Hm, is this the way? It is not the way we came, I am certain....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Oh, yes... My friend is very familiar with the streets around here. I am sure they know a shortcut. *to Scolexis* Isn't that right dear?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (to Louder Chasms): It is no issue, of course</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis pauses their step ahead, looks left, center, then right, and then waves to beckon the rest to follow.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (ushering Louder-Chasms): See? Right this way!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (rounding the corner in haste): Oh, my precious! I found you! You forgot something and I have come to return it into your soft hands.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Louder-Chasm: I.... something is not right. Where have all the people gone? If you do anything untoward, I shall scream! OH! Clear-flake! Thank goodness!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The silence is deafening. There is no one around. A small dust storm has closed off the end of the alley.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Louder-Chasm: Just this morning, I had the strangest dream.....</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (walks up behind Louder-Chasms and whispers in thier ear): Your life for Spire. Your blood for Lekole.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Louder-Chasm gasps!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis stabs Louder-Chasms in the side of the neck</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Louder-Chasm dies instantly. Blood runs down her side.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Well said Zilvice</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You hear a gong -- in the city? Or just for you? The dust storm passes. You look up, then back down, and hte body is gone.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis was staring out into the opposite direction.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Just... Tell me that she deserved it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I do hope so</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis places one of the colorful shawls from the perfomance onto Louder-Chasms, covering them</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (to Scolexis): She's Aelfir</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d10 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Louder-Chasm: </font> [d8 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d10 = 10]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice handled his first murder well. The edges of the shawl blow int he wind as you depart the alley.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I understand. However, if we are to take out our other target, I fear we must take out the child molestor we heard about before our &#34;brothers&#34; can take him out.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: You percieve time is of the essence in this cercomstance</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Glayjia Baylorn): circumstance</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Agreed. Time is of the essence</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis laments not bringing a vacuum flask.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: We can go to the orphanage, but I think it's more realistic to think of it as casing it for when our mark will arrive for... however you want to euphemize it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Very well. Let us find this orphanage. Keep in mind we may not be the only ones &#34;casing&#34; this orphanage</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You make your way back into the crowded areas of Red Row and towards The Orphanareum. The streets are as twisted and difficult to navigate as ever, but you are used to these passages and find your way there in no time. You pass by several drunken brawls and notice that the city guard has a large prresence than normal. Normally, a drunken brawl wouldn't even warrant a passing glance by a constable -- now it seems that men with badges are breaking up fights before they've really gotten into full swing. Something is amiss. But you have more immediate concerns. You arrive at your destination and behold The Orphanarium: Looking like the discarded butt-end of a cigarette dropped by some giant, it's cylindrical structure tapers off towards the rocky ceiling, where a series of circular, bubble-like dark alcoves make up the bedrooms. Each bedroom has a rope dangling from it, presumably as an entrance. You vaguely recall the atmosphere being branded as &#34;tree-house-like&#34;. You wonder how many kids have fallen to their deaths from these hundred-foot-high &#34;tree-houses&#34;.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: When I was a child I would have loved this. However, now that I am older I know now that I would have been mistreated. Now, I see us having a few choices. One, Knock on the door and inquire as the our target. Two, wait across the street till our target reveals himself. Three, do both.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Thoughts?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Um, hold that thought.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks about, trying to discern if any of the other would-be assassins have already beat them to the punch of intelligence gathering.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis doesn't recognize anyone, or see anything suspicious. Well, besides everything (this is Red Row, after all).</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis they shrug.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I guess we'll start with the direct approach?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Very well.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Oh, a thought had come to mind.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: What if I were to bewitch him into trying to take advantage of me and then I kill him?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks Glayjia up and down.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: The illusion can make you look smaller?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (Thoughtfully): ...No and yes. To him, I shall appear his ideal mate.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Pardon me while I stare at the ground some more.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">GLAMOUR</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: knocks on door</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The metalic thudding echoes through the building and is eventually answered by a haggard-looking Midwife. &#34;Yes?&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Greetings to you! I am seeking to speak with Drawn-cloud-Over_seas-Sparkling. May I see him?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Midwife: He is due to arrive soon. I don't believe he'll be taking visitors, however. Who can I tell him is calling?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Please tell him, his dream awaits him.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Midwife rolls her eyes and closes the door in your face.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn: walks back</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: We will have to wait</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I'm not looking, so tell me... Is that a targeted enchantment?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: No luck getting in, huh? What's the plan for when he does come through then?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Yes it is Scolexis you may look at me</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: To approch him and instroduce myself</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis sighs quietly to themself.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (looking up): Hm, but I'd still think having the complicity of a midwife would probably make this more of a success. Maybe if we were to explain our intentions more directly?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn Suddenly rememebers why Scolexis looks so familiar but keeps her mouth shut. She has a coy smile.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: You wish to admit to planning and performing a murder?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: ... How directly? Glayjia has a tendency to be a bit, on the noce if you will.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I think the midwife would sympathize. Maybe.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (pointing): exactly like that</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well, it wouldn't hurt to try once more, if you'd allow me.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Very well.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis nods and then shuffles toward the door, rapping their knuckles in a quiet, but not un-noticeable knock.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Midwife (opening the door once more): Yes, what is it nw?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (indicating themself): A wayward child begs the revered midwife a moment of their time.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis produces the can of Dagger as a bit of tribute.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Please?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2d10 = 7]<br />
<font color="#660066">Midwife: </font> [d4 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d10 = 4]<br />
<font color="#261A12">The midwife's eyes narrow. She remembers thm from long, long ago -- a careless moment involving Dagger and another child. Scolexis may themselves no longer remember. But this Midwife does. The recent incident with the flyers re-awoke the memory in her. She says nothing but shakes her head silently and closes the door. You feel as though she will not let it lie.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis recoils a bit, as though they were reliving a forgotten, terrible memory.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Soon after, a scrawny street rat greets you and as you clutch your pouch of silver, he drops a small piece of wadded up patchment on the ground before you.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis 's eyes shift about self-consciously before they stoop to smooth out the parchment to read it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The note reads, &#34;You are thirsty. When the panther thirsts, it returns to the oasis.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks around frantically for a door--any door.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scoleexis sees a door acriss the street -- it looks like the entrance to an abandoned house.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis lets out a little sigh, grateful that there's still a way for them to access the Vault. They collect themself and sheepishly rejoin the others.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well, you saw how it went...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis holds the note out.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Yes, not well.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I have no notion as to what this could mean</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: I think they are calling us back in... Just which they is it from?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: On the other hand, maybe it's the Vigilites on top giving us a clue?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: ah, good point. Let us return to the coffee shop?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Or that... But then what is the clue? </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis makes a denial gesture.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Don't mind me and my nonsense.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis asks GM &#34;Who's really in charge here?&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Right Glayjia, back to the coffee shop.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You arrive back at &#34;HQ&#34; to find a dark, empty building, the &#34;CLOSED&#34; sign still prominent. When you enter, you find Gleb, who motions you to sit. After you do so, he explains that &#34;a little bird&#34; told him that you were seen in the vicinity of a murdered Aelfir. He seems dispassionate, not angry.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gleb: Instead of doing as we asked, you are instead deepening the chaos here in the Row. I don't miss that high-lord scum any more than you do, but we do not draw attention to ourselves like this! You know this! And then I see you casing the orphanage where I know another high lord is due to make an appearance later today. I can put two and two together. Normally, we wouldn't be having this conversation. I'd cut my losses and give you up to the city guard. But, can you imagine, they didn't care! The place really is falling apart. So I will give you another chance. We subvert. We don't do anything that will bring the might of the high-elves down upon us.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gleb (scoffing): We're not the Crimson Vigil or something!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: But how are we supposed to undermine them without infiltrating? You must have seen the flyers too! It's a race to murder high-lords right now, and there's not stopping it unless you want us to overtly sabotage their spree.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: In the very least I can offer an explanation of the mechanism of why the play is popular. No motives, though. Other than lining pockets, of course.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gleb: Find a corpse and fake a murder!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I mean... it's good for tourism if we have high-lords coming down filling seats, right?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gleb: You're not infiltrating, you're actually becoming Vigilites!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis runs the simulations in their head on how they can fake murdering a high-lord.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: That's a valid point</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: But... Isn't that how you infiltrate?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gleb: Who do you think benefits from... &#34;tourism?&#34; It's Mother Moon, or The Sisters... or Mr. Winter. But not us! And we definitely don't benefit if those same high-lords start dropping like flies. At the very least we're going to get the type of attention we don't want.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gleb: Look, your methods are your own. Do what you will. But don't expect our help if wonton murder is the charge.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis rubs the back of their neck nervously.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Oh, geeze... we're really bad at this...</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gleb: We're supposed to be the good guys! Don't forget that.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gleb: Otherwise... what's the point?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn nods</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (bowing head): Our apologies sir. We only meant to gain acces to their organization to bring it down from the inside.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gleb: Well, don't waste the opportunity. But be more mindful in the future.... remember why you're doing this. That's all I ask.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: We shall. And thank you. We all want a better and brighter future. Prefereably not created with blood</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Gleb leaves you to think about how to proceed from here.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: So... That didnt exaclty go well</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: At least we're still in the Ministry.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: indeed</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: But I guess it didnt go as poorly as it could have either! We should probably try to figure out more about that play</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: and perhaps FAKE a couple more murders</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well, I'll attempt to explain why it's so popular. And in that attempt I'll also be testing out the extent of its influence.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis explains what they experienced during the play when they tried to figure out its magic--the how and the whens.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis expresses some relief that they don't feel compelled to watch the play again after that explanation.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Kinda ingenious.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Hmm, yes. I felt muchg the same. It also explains how such a terrible play can be so popular</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: It's also self-perpetuating.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So here's the question: what's the more effective and efficient way of dealing with it? Fighting fire with fire, or making it grossly unpopular and fizzle out?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: What do you mean? We make a play of our own?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Or promote another production. But the kicker would be to weave in the same trick that the Weeping Maiden is using. If every show in the Row is using the same trick, then what would it matter anymore?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: The enchantment is subtle and devious. It puts a monopoly on a single thing. If we flood the market, then it'll dilute its power.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Wait.. I'm befuddled a tad. Is not our one and only mission to infiltrate that cult?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Perhaps, or it may just make more addicts. If we are trying to get rid of them it may be better to drive them out. Wether that be by making them unpopular or just making them *want* to leave.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Golly. I thought our job was to put out fires.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Figuratively.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Sure. I would love to figuratively burn the play to the ground. make no mistake. But there is a bigger picture here.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I think we need to find a cremetorium and steal two corpses</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Is there a crematorium on this level?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There are a lot of fire in Red Row. Some of them serve as lighting. Others as crematoriums. But usually both.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis thinks for a moment.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ... well, maybe we can just poach some bodies from novice Vigilites?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Perhaps we can kill two carrion with a single stone..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: What if I threw a party outside the theater? I can ask around were we can obtain a cadaver for.. my next play and pull some people from the theater and convince them magic is in use</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis scratches their head.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Wow. That sounds... elaborate.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Does it? It is quite a simple matter</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis takes a moment to consider the most sensible way to acquire an Aelfir corpse without having to do the deed themselves.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I am well versed in creating spontanious parties. I had to learn this skill when trying to impress those with influence</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [3d10 = 17]<br />
<font color="#660066">Gleb: </font> [d6 = 4]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d10 = 3]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis racks their memory for the location of an Aelfir body, within Red Row preferably. Eureka! There's a woman, named Regine, but who goes by the moniker &#34;Sister Reg&#34; who has subtley been &#34;purchasing&#34; aelfir bodies from sources. She has a compound near the Ichor Woods. You head over and find it fairly easily. It's a fenced-in derelict mansion, with torches strapped to the fence and lit creating a theme-park-like feeling. There isn't a soul in sight. She must be inside.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I have a feeling that this is going to be a &#34;favours for favours&#34; encounter at best.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I have silver I can reliquish. Perhaps she will favor that?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Okay. I'll knock on the door then.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn knocks on the door</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There is no response. But you hear  ghoulish laughter echoing from within.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...Try the handle?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn tries the handle</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The door yields to your touch. It swings open with a creak. The sounds of the city fall away as you step inside. The decor is odd -- very expensive-looking furniture, but all torn up, with blood splotching the floor and cushions. You hear more laughter and the sound of some wet squelching from farther down.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (visibly recoiling at the sounds): You first</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: This isn't ominous in the slightest.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Very well, I see a women is required to do a mans job!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn Walks confidently towards the sounds</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis shrugs</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis follows behind.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The sounds seem to be coming from the kitchen. You peek inside and see a person entirely covered in thick clothing, which is covered in blood, weilding a hacksaw and sawing off the leg of a body lying on the kitchen table. Several other corpses lie piled in the corner. The sink overflows with various limbs.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn knocks on the wall</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Hello? Darling? </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Sister Reg stops sawing and turns around.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sister Reg: Bodies for Sister? Leave 'em there. *points to the corner with the bodies*</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Actually we were wondering if we could buy or aquire some of your bodies?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: just two</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Sister Reg considers this.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sister Reg: You wish to... TAKE a body? TWO bodies?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (Not wanting to anger Sister Reg): Yes, with your permission of course</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sister Reg: Do... do you have permission from Mr. Winter?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You recognize this name as one of the &#34;bosses&#34; of Red Row.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Are these not Your bodies to do with as you please?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">looks down at the half-sawn leg, pauses, and turns back to you. She bursts out laughing, twirling around once in her swaths of bloody clothing.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Sister Reg looks down at the half-sawn leg, pauses, and turns back to you. She bursts out laughing, twirling around once in her swaths of bloody clothing.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sister Reg: This is all the domain of Mr. Winter! You may leave corpses, particularly hoity-toity ones, but not take!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I understand, so we must talk with Mr. Winter?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Sister Reg is about to nod when she suddenly freezes. She drops her saw and runs up to Scolexis and grabs his hand.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Eep! Y-yes?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: THEIR hand</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sister Reg: This is.... this one.,... *grasps Scolexis's pinky finger tightly*.... it's.... I need it. I need it.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Sister Reg looks up into Scolexis's face, pleadingly.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sister Reg: You want to TAKE a body? You can take one! In exchange for this! *yanks on their pinky roughtly*</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis stifles a squeak and looks at Glayjia and Zilvice with tears in their eyes.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I...</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (pushing himself between Scolexis and Reg): Dear sister... There must be another arrangement we can find. Poor Scolexis is so very skilled with their hands, it would be a shame to sully them</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Sister Reg does not seem to understand. At some level, you get that it's *because* Scolexis is so good with their hands that their fingers appeal to this woman.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sister Reg: No pinky, no deal!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sister Reg (laughing): Talk to Mr. Winter.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I'm sure the answer will not help anything but I must know. why do you need their pinky?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sister Reg (after considering the question for a momeont): If I show you, promise not to laugh?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (quietly to Scolexis): You *dont* want to part with your fingers, correct?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Yes, I's sure I won't laugh.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (stammering): I-I mean... Not if I don't have to?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis cradles their prized pinky with their other hand.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Sister Reg let's go of Scolexis's finger and jumps up brightly in excitement. She shouts &#34;Be right back!&#34; as she tears out of the room, sliding across some blood pooled on the floor and just barely maintaining her balance before she disappears from view and you hear her footsteps receding.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I-I don't know... No, I know if I will regret this. But I must know.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn waits in horror</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis stands there silently thinking of all the good times they've had with their pinky.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (looking around the room): What an existance... And to enjoy it as much as she clearly does.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis tries not to touch anything</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I would envy her if I wasn't so creeped out</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">A minute or two later, Sister Reg returns carrying some object under her arm. You can't see her expression well through the blood-soaked cloth but her stance reeks of pride. She holds it up. It's a statue of a moss-chicken, but made from various bits of flesh and bone. It seems to be missing a beak, however.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The statue hums with power. It's no ordinary pile of flesh and blood.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Wow. I am. Impressed</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I can tell this is an artifact of great power</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Sister Reg nods vigorously.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: anyyywaysss. We should go see Mr. Winter.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: We shall see you again soon I hope</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (to Galyjia): Do you know how to find Mr. Winter?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: oh, good point.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Sister Reg, can you tell us where he is?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sister Reg: No one talks to Mr. Winter. But I can tell you how to get a message to him.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Yes, please!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">She tells you of an art gallery nearby where you can have a message sent to Mr. Winter. After sefveral exchanges of such messages with the gallery's receptionist, Mr. Winter makes it clear that the bodies mean a lot to him. There is a threatening undertone to his messages. You feel as though a large enough sum of money would, like ever in Red Row, smooth any ruffled feathers and get the deal done, but you don't have nearly enough. If the three of you pooled your resources and called in some favors, you might be able to scrounge the amount together but it would mean having to find an alternative food-source for the next month.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: hmmm perhaps we can ask Mr.Winter if he could arange for Scolexis and I to have appeared to have murdered two elfeir?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: If I'm in his shoes, I'd be asking what it was in it for him.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: And that's being charitable.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: hmmm</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: perhaps one of us can dress as an aelfir and we can pretend murder them?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks at the other two, then their own reflection in their can of Dagger.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well... I guess if you can Glamour it up?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Would we still need a body?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: That's not how works</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: No</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: How does it work?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I can kinda feel what a person's ideal partner would be and appear as them in their eyes.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Right right... So you can not apear as a dead Aelfir. Because who would think of that as an ideal partner?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Well if anyone, it would be the woman we just met with.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: We still need bodies. The Vigil has charged us with killing three Aelfir. *Somehow* they know that we have killed one...</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: 'll give up a pinky.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So... that leaves us with one more body, right?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I still don't know if that would work</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I say we try to steal a body before we start chopping off pinkies</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Actually.... I agree with Glayjia.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: There is still a chance we could even just tell them we did it and they wouldn't even know...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So whose aelfir are we going to steal?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: worth a try</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I'm assuming the priest?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis scratches their head.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: The priest has a body to steal?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: No it is his body we will steal</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis looks confused</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis also looks confused.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: We know of him due to a conversation we overheard where two of our brothers were planning on killing him to join this murder happy cult. So, it goes without saying there is a dark elf out there who will murder that priest.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Ohh. Well, I guess we ought to hop to it, then!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: or walk, yes..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...Should we... I dunno. Slink instead?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn gives Scolexis an amused look</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I meant the orphanage owner</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: sorry, both are rather... pedo to me</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (muttering): Well, you're not wrong there...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: We just need to watch the place for when someone tries to kill the man</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: when they do, we steal the body</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis searches their memory for a good hiding place for the occasion.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Geeze. Other than picking some random nursery pod, I dunno.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I mean alternatively we could go back to Rat Catch and hope that there's some would-be Vigilites who are flapping their gums about their next hit.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Would be nice to get a read on the &#34;competition&#34;.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Fine with me</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You make your way back to Ratcatch. Scolexis has a knack for finding these stations. Nothing in Underspire is in the exact spot you left it, but this is doubly true for the abandoned stations that pepper the place. Only those with the Sage's background seem able to understand the undercurrents of magic that permeate the place. Ratcatch is mostly as abandoned as when you left it. You follow the pale flicker of light. A small shanty-town, lit by burning barrels, has sprung up. You notice some graffiti across the barrels, which Zilvice points out is a secret Vigilite symbol. He doesn't know how he knows this.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis fidgets.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: You-you'd... think it'd be easier since we're already insurgents... and murderers.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis has a miniature crisis, despite being in the service industry.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I would very much be interested in meeting a member of the vigilites.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn looks around for life</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Glayjia Baylorn): signs of life</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There are several people milling listlessly about the shantytown. Several of them seem jittery and probably high. Some lie facedown and their body slowly rises up and down with their breath.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hm, not as scrappy as I'd thought.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (approaches the nearest person and says): Who's in charge 'round here?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The woman's eyes flicker to life for a second as sher focuses on Zilvice's face. She jerks her hand weakly towards a  tent in the center.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (waving the others on): Right.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis follows, trying their best to act like they belong there.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis heads to the center tent and knocks on the side</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">&#34;Come in,&#34; says a voice from within gruffly.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis opens the door slowly and enters</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Inside is the retch of death. A body lies sprawled across a matress in the center. Blood has pooled and dried, soaking into the mattress. The rest of the inside is a mess. Piles of junk and glassware lie scattered throughout the cramped space. There is no light, and the flickering light of the fire behind you illuminates the back of the corpse.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Um, nice catch?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice (snarling): What do you want?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis figuratively shrinks.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: We have come to report our success.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis bows his head slightly</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: Recruits, eh?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">A pair of glowing red eyes appear a foot or so from the corpse. The light seems to.... miss them, somehow.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">They peer into Zilvice's eyes. He does not look away.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: Hmm. Yes, you have done Lekole a great service.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: You are welcome to our ranks. Those behind you, are they recruits as well? Or thralls?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Recruits. Sir.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis smiles nervously.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: Let them speak for themselves. I must check their eyes.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I-I-I... think you'll find that I was *quite* the accomplice, sir!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: Accomplice! Pshaw.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: You must destroy.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (muttering): There are only so many aelfir to go around...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I was ready to take the life myself but as the target was Zilvice's I let him take it. I awhait the next</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: Why are you here?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I care little of the life of an aelfir but before I join a clan where my life is there's I wish to know what there goals are. Could you enlighten me?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: Did your parents teach you of Lekole?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Unfortunatly, no.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: This is the highest of their crimes, these pale slavemasters. They killed our people, and enslaved us all, but stamping out two of our mothers... this stops our people from fighting back. Despicable. I cannot be your priest, young one. I can only tell you that deep in your blood runs Lekole's blood -- and that blood thirsts for Vengeance. You will not be satisfied without it. Luckily, in today's Spire, there is no lack of targets. The Crimson Vigil worships Lekole and seeks to destroy the despicable Aelfir at any cost. You were drawn here by the pull of Our Lady of Vengeance. Speak not her name to our slavemasters, until you run your blade across their pale throats.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: Some of our number would tell you that our goal is removal of the Aelfir. This is not so -- our goal is only vengeance. Blood for the blood goddess.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: What about after this vengeance? Will the goddess ever be satisfied?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Who will rule?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: I envy your optimism, young one. When the blood of all the Aelfir has turned the Underspire into a swimming pool, only then should we concern ourselves with what Our Lady wants next.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: It is of no concern to us who would rule in such a scenario. We will not see it in our lifetime. Or in any lifetime, in my opinion. If you ask me, we are doomed to kill each other, us two. Aelfir and drow.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So, uh...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: What do our eyes tell you?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: And you think such a life for all Drow and aelfir for all time is a good life?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: What if the aelfir respond to these attacks? Is there a plan for defence or attack?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice (to Scolexis): Nothing, yet. Kill in Lekole's name and I shall open the path for you.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...Sounds good.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice (to Glayjia): What alternative do we have? The feckless Ministry thinks that through subversion and cunning we might one day rule Spire once more. Pshaw. Even if this was a realistic goal, my interest is in making the Aelfir pay for the crimes they have already committed. My blood aches for Vengeance, and..... before you you see the result *the eyes dip down to indicate the corpse*. Killing her did not create a.... &#34;good life....&#34; for anyone. But it pleased Lekole. In time, she will dispense vengeance upon all of these bastards.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: When we have completed this task. What is the next step?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: There is nothing more, my brother. You are one of us. You know our sign. You may recruit others. You do not have to.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: Unlike the ministry, we do not assign &#34;tasks.&#34; There is only one task: Vengeance. We do not have masters. Do as you will. Lekole will reward you for it. Occassionally, there may be a moot. You will find us, or we will find you.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Were you always this vengful or was it only when you joined The Crismson Vigil?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: What else is left to us but vengeance? Some realize it early, others later. I myself realized there was no other path after my durance master beat my sister to death.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: For that I am sorry. They see us but as insects with a use. We must show them their error. </font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice (hissing): Agreed.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: What can I call you?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: No names.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Very well No Name.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I thank you for speaking with me.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The eyes dip in a small bow.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn performs a small bow</font><br />
<font color="#000066">voice: One more thing -- do not so casually announce yourselves as members of our order. As I'm sure you knwo, the penalty for being a member is death. If you saw my face, like I have seen yours, I would have to kill you.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis tries to work out mentally if all of this is strictly on the Religious side of the arcane.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn bows again.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis makes a face as if to say, &#34;Whoops.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis is fairly certain that there are very strong Occult vibes here.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis tries to figure out what spell or combination of spells Sir &#34;No Name&#34; had used.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [3d10 = 15]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis does not see magic of any sort at work here. It is likely the shanty-town itself, a sort of &#34;cover&#34; for the Vigilite, was put together using some occult fire-building trickery of the sort Lekole's followers espouse. But the vigilite here is the real deal. He killed the corpse as he claims, and likely will kill again. It's not clear why he's holding on to the corpse. It might be a form of occult ritual that strengthens his resolve.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Scolexis gets Mastery on the next Vigil-related roll</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Anyone have any further questions?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (shaking head slowly): No, I think we know what we must do.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (deadpan): Kill for the Blood Moon.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis gives a half-hearted thumbs up.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Seems clear enough.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Very well. Then we will take our leave.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (saluting): for our mother of vengence</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn exits the tent</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis follows</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis shuffles after them.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">(Somehow, you feel sure that the &#34;Sirs&#34; and salutes were uncalled for. Not that it matter.)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Let us go a safe distance?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (quietly to the group, once at a safe distance from the tent): So, that answers that... They can *definitely* tell if we've actually killed for Lekole.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn walks to a dark corner out of ear shot of anyone</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Yes, they can.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: However, the good news is we don't need to kill anyone else</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Does that make us your thralls?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: I suppose it may... Though I did kind of already say you weren't.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Thanks for that.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So... Mission accomplished with the Vigil?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Kind of, I think. I don't see a point in infiltrating any further. For, what would be the purpose? there are many leaders all who have the same simple objective. Kill ealfir in the name of their god. No one can do anything about this until the Drow have a better quality of life. Or so I suspect.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Was the plan for ME to infiltrate or for US to infiltrate?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Us</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Then we need to kill more Aelfir.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Specifically YOU need to kill Aelfir.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Remind me why we need to infiltrate them in the first place?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: That... Thing in there stared into my eyes and knew what I had done. I didn't need to tell hinm anything. I will not be the only one on the hook for these lunatics.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Hold on I have one more question for him.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Actually... What do you guys say to trying to talk with Mr.Winter?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Again? I thought he gave us the brush off.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Good point Scolexis. Zilvice, I'm sorry you had to kill someone. But i don't think further murder is the answer here. You killing was enough. You are IN. If we have any questions, you can ask. specifically WHO is pulling the strings? what started this mayhem a month ago?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well, I *might* be able to get us on the right path for that. And I can either do it alone, or take the two of you with me and risk mayyybe some brain damage.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (softly): Mayyyybe.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: What do you suggest Scolexis?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Let do it and try and avoid the brain damage</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well, luckily we're at a station... Maybe it won't be so bad.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis offers their hands, one hand each, to the other two.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: We're going to take a trip to the Vault!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn takes Scolexis's hand</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (takes Scolexis' hand somewhat doe eyed): The Vault? Really?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hang onto that happy thought, because things are about to get weird for you.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: hmmm</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: oookaayyy</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis leads them to any old mundane door still attached to Ratcatch station.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Big, deep breaths. And away we go!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The door opens into a bright light. Zilvice and Glayjia reflexivly move to shield their faces but when they feel no pain, they follow Scolexis through the door. On the other side is a maze of small, well-let rooms. The room you're in contains two giant piles of books and various other paper paraphanelia. A small gnoll sits between the two piles, taking books from one pile, flipping through them, and tossing them into the tother. You look up to see the source of the light is a lightbulb (a rare magical contrivance that doesn't exist outside the Vermissian, but that you heard rumors about). Above the lightbulb is another room, with multiple doors and an upside down stairway. You're not sure how you would even get to it. Beyond the stairway, you see more rooms stretching away at impossible angles -- into the very air of the station from which you just came.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Welcome to the Vermissian Vault.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Your mind reels from the strange geometry.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [2d10 = 9]<br />
<font color="#660066">voice: </font> [d6 = 1]<br />

<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Wow!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: How do you... Who....What?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (pointing at the bulb): ... Is that? Scolexis, you truly are a surprise.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Whew! And I didn't have to get you guys any gauze for blood tears.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis cups their chin and looks about.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: uhhh, you could have warned us about that..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hm, now... This seems to be as good a place as any to start our research.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well, I *did* bring up the possibility of brain damage. Everything else is just sort of... inconvenient in comparison.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So here's what I was thinking.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Please continue</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: We cross-reference phases of the moon with blood sacrifices. There may be a timeline somewhere some*when* where a mass amount of Aelfir bloodshed was utilized for some reason linked to Lukole.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: oh... That's a good point!</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">The ministers find themselves in the Vermisian Vault, a strange place in which only Scolexis seems to understand what is going on., </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...We cross-reference phases of the moon with blood sacrifices. There may be a timeline somewhere some*when* where a mass amount of Aelfir bloodshed was utilized for some reason linked to Lukole.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis notices the gnoll, finally, and searches their memory for any recollection of who they are.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis has never seen this gnoll before. Probably.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I'll take your word for it... </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: this is beyond me</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well, this space is... &#34;procedural&#34; to put it in the simplest terms. We may be navigating through some non-Euclidian geometric layouts for some time before finding anything pertinent.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis frowns but then grins sheepishly.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: But think of all the things we may see along the way!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: uh ha</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis squats and looks up and down the titles that the gnoll has in their discard pile.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Um, by the by... would either of you classify yourselves as &#34;pokers&#34; or casual &#34;lookie-loos&#34;?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: If you would be so kind as to explain both terms I would answer</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (sounding confused): Poker?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Wellll, the Vault is full of all sorts of detritus and artifacts from different times and possible anywhens. So there may be things that may defy explicit explanation. So are you guys the type to pick something up before asking or appraising something before gently giving it a tap?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gnoll (muttering): Really shoulda asked that *before* bringing them here....</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis rubs the back of their head.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Yeah, sorry... I got a touch excited.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: When one's mind is nearly broken, one does not go around touching things.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Oh... Well, I suppose in a place like this.... I'm more of a &#34;lookie-loo&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I'm scared to even look at anything the wrong way</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Like that stone angel over there in the case. It almost feels like it's watching me..</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (to Glayjia): What a trip right/?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Yes indeed! I'm also facinated! Remember I spend my durance as an information broker. This would have been very useful.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Welp, I'mma gonna stick to tomes and diagrams. If either of you find something that suits your fancy, like clothing or an instrument or super deadly weapon that probably isn't cursed or posessed, then... poke with discretion.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: The moment any of us receives a grievous wound or other kind of trauma we'll head back to real space and hope that it's our original timeline.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I will take your advice with a pitcher of salt</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...W-would some Dagger help?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: No..no thank you Scolexis</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis stands up and stretches.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Wellll, let's give this area a thorough search before trying the next door.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis sniffs the air, hoping to get a hint of a direction of a coffee station.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [3d10 = 12]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d3 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">Gnoll: </font> [d3 = 1]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis spends some time pouring coffee and digging through buries archives -- the sort that fill your nostrils with the smell of old, dried ink and mildew. Where did all of this come from? How does Scolexis know where it is? These questions are difficult to answer. Several hours later, however, Scolexis has managed to graph the mentions of the Scarlet Vigil crossed with mentions of particular geographic locaitons of their victims. This is difficult as it's usually unclear that a murder is related in any way to the Scarlet Vigil at all. Generally speaking, a lot of their activity happens pretty evenly throughout Spire. But Scolexis notes that about twenty years ago, there was an uptick in the number of Vigil-related deaths in the Underspire, and interestingly, many of the victims weren't even Aelfir. It seems that a cell of Vigilites had gone rogue and been hired by Mr. Winter (at least according to the gossip of the time) in a turf war with the Sisters.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis vibrates as they explain their findings to Glayjia, Zilvice, and the gnoll.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: It could be a thing!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis sips their coffee to keep their jitters down.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Also: how are you? I am fine.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis licks the spout of the empty carafe.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Scolexis, I mean this with no offence intended, are you well in the head?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis smiles a little and nods, then slowly shakes their head, and then shrugs with their arms up in a &#34;what can you do?&#34; sort of gesture.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (quietly): Have... you had a fun time here in the Vault?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn starts to say something then stops.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I wouldn't descibe it as fun. More like an informative phycoactive tumble</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I particulary enjoyed the painting on the wall over there(pointing). The one labeled Dragon and Dz-. I found myself staring at it for quite some time. Oh and the sword on the stand there(pointing). According to the desciption it has a liquid of sorts inside to make executions easier and smoother.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Sounds merciful.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (addressing his friends): So, do you think Mr.Winter is to blame again? If so, what was his goal before and what is his goal now?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: He's definitely involved... Not sure to what end though.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I dunno... seems like a &#34;business as usual&#34; kinda power play. Kinda makes me wonder if all of the goings-on in the Row right now are each of the factions playing a different game.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis cups their chin.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Who seems to be the most likely candidate for the play?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Anyone who stands to benefit from making the common people blind of something else. Which is everyone</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: In fact, I don't see what that play has to do with this situation.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Just suggesting that each of the main three faction each has their own cunning ploy in play simultaneously.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I have an idea! I'll throw a party outside the office of Mr. Winters, for Mister Winters.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: For the purpose of asking him or a rep some questions</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: thoughts?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hmm... Is there an occasion to do that?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Something that you can coopt and catch him off guard about?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Nope. But I have a good tounge</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: As long as we don't draw attention to ourselves while doing that... I'm in.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Good point</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (unconvinced): If you say so... But while you're in the Vault--and I mean *you*, both of you--is there anything you want to look for and hopefully retrieve while you are still of sound mind?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Perhaps a record of Mr. Winters? I would like to know what he could have gained and could gain now</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Scolexis): incessantly</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (Thoughtfully): Actually.... You know what's been bugging me incessantly? This play. I know I just spoke about Mr. Winters but he's such a big player that it may be difficult to extract information. But I suspect this play has a larger role to..heh, play in all this. I say we look into the play write</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: \</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I know her name is Gallop-through-Sky and she rose up extremely quickly. Even for an aelf.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Probably easier to keep our heads down too. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Okay, so then we want to look into the play, right?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hm, but my question is if the magic is intrinsic to the play itself or if it's added by th eperformers.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks around.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So... back to research?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Yes.. I'll go ahead and look</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: with help</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">After some digging, Scolexis locates the script. It isn't very hard, as its a fairly new.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis flips through the scipt, looking for traces of magic embedded into the play itself.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Scolexis): *by design.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis can't find any trace of magic in the paper, or in the words. It seems the source of the magic was the performers themselves, or someone who was at the performance.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: What if we look at those who funded the play?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Are you saying that they aren't some kind of rags-to-riches kind of production that stumbled on bottled lightning?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis is sincerely aghast.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: No. I'm saying that the production of rags is still rags but a benofactor made a rag look like a silk cloth</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn starts looking around for financial records to determine who is casting this spell</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis starts writing in the margins of the play where they remember the magic was taking place.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (humming): &#9835;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis finds the playbill, along with an interview with the performers taken when the play first started to pick up steam about a month ago. The person giving the interview is named Veronike, and she comes across as the &#34;edgy&#34; type of performance artist. They even have a name for themselves -- The Sunlight Collective. It sounds like it really was a &#34;rags to riches&#34; story, except that the Sunlight Collective was never really looking for fame, according to Veronike.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Kind of inspiring, actually.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Did you want to infiltrate the troop with your star power?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis gestures with emphasis.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: *Star* power?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis tries again.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ~*/Star\*~ power!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Strange.. I can hear unexplainable characters outside the word Star.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Yes</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I do</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Ya... wanna do like a guerilla performance and cast Party to bring in attention so that they can't help but recruit you?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis fans the script in their hand.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: I may be able to help you prepare...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: But it would take some time before</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: before what?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Your debut into the world of the-a-tre.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis does spirit fingers.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis sort of joins in doing spirit fingers</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: sounds like a good idea. I'll set up an after party. So when the next performance ends I'll throw a party outside the theatre.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis pulls on their apron.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hm.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks at Zilvice.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Where... do we figure, exactly?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: That's not hard to find out. Just ask around for where the next performance will be</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (shrugs): Entourage?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Your debut into the world of the-a-tre.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Okay so here's what we need. We will be hosting an impromptue After Party in front of the theater. Gaerlan, I may need some help setting up. Scolexis, if you can find and make enough coffee, drug free coffee please, for everyone who might attend.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks around for a porta-keg while they're still in the Vault.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn heads over to The Theater timing to arive an hour prior to the end of the play. Zilvice couches glayjia on clothing and mannerisms actors would find trusting and willing to open up for. Glayjia drags a ragged wooden table from an alleyway to the front of the theater. Next, she rips some curtains off the palehouse stalls and covers the table with them. Lastly, she drops a porta-keg of coffee onto the table, &#34;borrows&#34; some cups. And waits. As the crowd spills out she waits patiently. Less and less are leaving the theater until the actors we recognise start walking out surrounded by a few fans. Glayjia, turns to Scolexis and laughs loudly but charmingly. &#34;Yes indeed! The ending was just astounding&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn &#34;oh hello!&#34; please please, you must all be weary enjoy some refreshments and relax.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The actors, high off of their most recent performance, are completely unsurprised by the impromptu party and begin to get deep into the cups rather quickly, many still in costime.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis nods to themself as they take note of the details of the costumes up close.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis also looks for any sort of spell foci or paraphernalia.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2d10 = 13]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis can find no trace of magic, now. Based on their previous experience, and lacking any other source, Scolexis concludes that this must therefore be ritual magic, and the ritual had been performed elsewhere.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis cups their chin, pondering this conclusion as they pass out their Dagger'ed up coffee.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn walks over to Gallop-through-Sky</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Gallop-through-Sky is an imposing figure, unsually so for a playwright. Normally, he would be a scary man to approach, but on the barrel to his left are two empty cups of Scolexis Special and one very heavily used flaggon. He doesn't seem like a happy drunk and instead sulks in the corner, eyeing the crowd and waiting for an opportune time to refill his cup.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: GTS! Wonderful to see you darling! It's been ages! It's Glayjia Baylorn! Writer of Her Crescent Light</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The writer looks Glayjia up and down, without recognition.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Who are you? Do I know you?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Of course you do darling! You just drank too much coffee is all. In fact, you may not rememeber as you may have had a bit too much root ale that night. But what about this big break for you? Congratulations are in order! You've put quite the &#34;spell&#34; on the people haven't you?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn Looks to see a reaction to the word &#34;spell&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [3d10 = 12]<br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [d3 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [d10 = 8]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia notices a small mote of surprise when he hears the word.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gallop-through-Sky: Huh. What are you trying to say? And what if we did? What're you gonna do?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gallop-through-Sky grasps the flaggon tightly with his right hand and tries to steady himself.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Gallop calm yourself please. I didn't intend to offend. I was just saying the people love your work! As if you'd be so rotten to take advanage of the people like this. You're a drow after all. You wouldn't help the aelfir make things even worse for our people. You're work is a testiment of that. Showing clearly how decietful the aelf are with such a tale of deciete,  revenge, murder..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Gallop-through-Sky looks mollified by this praise, but Galyjia gets the impression that saying more, here, in the middle of the party, will set him off.... which, perhaps, could lead to some interesting results. The ministers turn to cosnidering how to learn more about *why* the troupe had performed this ritual.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis takes the opportunity while the guests are entertained by Glayjia and Scolexis to skulk into the shadows and make his way to the troupes wagon looking for incriminating evidence or information on the ritual.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [2d10 = 17]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice eyes the mess as he slides beneath the wagon curtain. Good -- less to clean up. He rifles through the belongings, being careful not to disturb the pile too much. Tucked away in a pair of pants that belong to someone who must have changed into costume, Zilvice finds a srumpled note reading: &#34;Pymt  in usual spot. Continue as agreed through end of week. Next pymt double.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis gathers up signatures from Dagger'ed up castmates on the manuscript that they hung onto from the Vault.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks around the party to find Glayja--they flail in a manner as if to say, &#34;Are you done yet?&#34;</font><br />

<font color="#005500"> (Glayjia Baylorn): back</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice found a mystrerious note in some pants. The note was setting up a meeting between someone in the troupe and a mysterious entitity. The ministers decide to track down this mysterioues person. To this end, they wait until the party winds down and watch as the cast and crew take turns changing back into their street clothes. Just when they begin to wonder if they have missed it, the lead actress who played the princess in the play dips into the wagon and emerges soon after, wearing the pants. The ministers plot their next move...</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (hushed): Oh geeze... it had to be the lead...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: i thought her acting was criminal!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So... what are we going to do?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: We follow her, no? Find out who that note was from.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Or ask her &#34;politly&#34; to tell us where the drop is.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Glayjia Baylorn): politely</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: And what? Go in her place? I think that if we coerce her to tell us, ther is potential she may tip them off.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: dark side, light side, day star to determine which method?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Well... we're basically the ministry of cloak and dagger-y. Let's gather intel before doing something rash. Hopefully without drawing any attention...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: You guys can sneak but clearly I cannot. I can try again I guess</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Can we just sort of... I dunno. Give you the opposite of a makeover? A glow-down?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: You can try?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks away from Glayjia, shielding their eyes.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Y... you're right. This may be a challenge.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks to Zilvice.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Um... got a mask for her, maybe?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (pulling out servant mask): Already on it...</font><br />
<font color="#660066">DRESS FOR SUCCESS</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [2d10 = 13]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2d10 = 16]<br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [2d10 = 14]<br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis walks up tp Glayjia and raising his servant mask to her face sizes it up. &#34;Looks like it'll fit. Put this on. May be a bit big so pull the straps on the side to make it snug.&#34; He continues by mussing her hair a bit and tells her &#34;If anyone asks, master Qinrel has you on an errand and you can't speak of it. Shouldn't be an issue, but just in case.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The ministers, lightly disguised, follow the actress through the winding streets of Red Row. She and several other members of the troupe meet up nearby for a smoke, then head to a lounge discreetly specializing in mushrooms, a common, if illicit, after-party activity. As the night comes on, tea and a light dinner is served and the troupe haggles loudly with the owner over costs, an argument the troupe appears to lose. Eventually they fall asleep in the lounge, which is apparently allowed, since the owner carts out several cots for this purpose. The ministers are getting tired as they peek through the curtains at the snoring troupe.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The ministers consider their options....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hm. Not as glamourous as I thought.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Does this seem suspicious to anyone?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis yawns.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Only in so far as they don't seem to be pocketing as much money as they seem to be making?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Well, the price did just double...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: should we watch in shifts?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis quietly chuckles.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Sleep? What's that?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis drinks coffee.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis fights sleep!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Rrrrarl!</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d10 = 8]<br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis digs into their pockets and counts their beans... Deciding to chew some for the first hour, and then snort some espresso every hour after seemed to be the best strategy since they don't remember the last time they slept.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (in a singsong sort of way): Musn't sneeze, musn't sneeze, gotta keep the sleepies away~</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis ponders their forbidden technique: the dreaded coffee bean suppository...</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Glayjia Baylorn): ew</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There are no sunrises in Red Row, and that is well, but daybreak makes itself known never-the-less with the singing of the Smokesong, a traditional chant performed by the beggars of Red Row to loosen pockets. Soon after, the actress the Ministers have been following rouses from sleep and quietly slips away before her companions wake. She slips out through the back and Scolexis taps Zilvice and Glayjia until they groan awake. Then they follow the actress into a seemingly-endless garbage heap. They smell it before they see it. Understandably, the streets are empty in this area. They follow the actress behind a hill of discarded tupperware and moist towelettes. When they round the corner, the actress is nowhere to be seen.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: hmmmmm</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Whew... time to focus...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis closes their eyes and hums.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis slumps.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Welp, I tried.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: we just need to investigate the area. Look for some hidden doors</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis starts by looking up, since people tend to not.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2d10 = 16]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis notices that part of this garbage pile doesn't fit with the rest. There is a &#34;hidden cave&#34; of sorts in the pile, a trick of the eyes. The ministers squeeze past some moldy fruit and see a metal tunnel in the ground, leading downwards. They follow the tunnel for some time until it opens up into a larger one. The smell here is bad, even after having acclimated to the garbage dump. This must be the infamous Gutter, sewer system of Spire. In the distance the Ministers hear the scraping of metal on metal. They cautiously turn the corner and see the actress, now wearing a small backpack of sorts, walking away from a pile of metal piping. Approaching the pile, they see that behind it lies a small chest with a combination lock.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (quietly): What should we do? Try to head her off at the lounge?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: either that or stake out this spot for a week</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Back Door</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Glayjia Baylorn): can't open back door</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn sigh so be it</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (sighing): so be it</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">At Scolexis's prompting, the Minsiters decide to find the &#34;other side&#34; of the drop point in The Vault. Scolexis knows where the entrance is -- there are many in the Gutter. They open the door and Glayjia and Zilvice brace themselves, knowing that just knowledge isn't enough to protects their minds from this place. They step through.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [2d10 = 11]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [2d10 = 10]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Everyone still sane?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Porklosinge!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: oh, yes. I'm fine</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (shaking his head clear): Yeah, I think so... Is it always sooo... Intense?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The ministers manage to keep their minds in one piece. They behold this place -- the same as last time, yet completely different. Instead of the gravity-defying library that they experienced last time, this time it is a much larger space -- seemingly extending beyond the range of their vision in all directions. Small, knee-high bookshelves pepper the ground, and sometimes, when they turn around, they notice doors or marble statues that had not been there before.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: You'll get used to it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The hard work then begins. The doorway to the chest in the Gutter must be found.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d10 = 4]<br />
<font color="#005500"> (Glayjia Baylorn): looks for a drink me sign</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Thankfully time is just a suggestion in this space!</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d8 = 7]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d10 = 10]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...Am... I having a seizure?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: maybe time to stop sniffing ground up beans?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Days pass. Weeks pass. Maybe months pass. Scolexis wanders from door to door, shelf to shelf, muttering, and Zilvice and Glayjia stumble along behind them. Time loses all meaning. At some point, there is an unspoken agreement that it's time to return -- but all the doors seem to lead to strange places that have floors of teeth, and rainfalls of crimson blood. Winds begin to whip the library as the Ministers wake on yet another &#34;morning.&#34; Not a single soul can be seen in all this time. Finally, after an unknown amount of time of this, Scolexis simply can't find any more doorways, at all.  The Vault has become an empty plane. Only a single statue remains, the apparent centerpoint of this unholy hell. As the ministers collapse before it, the statue's mouth moves.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Statue: You have reached customer service. Please leave your message after the tone.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The statue emits a long, steady-pitched sound, and appears to await the ministers' response.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Um... connect me to Gyorothos Ilnivar, please. I'll wait.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis lies on the floor.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The statue emits an odd noise that repeats, like the warbling of a bird. It does this for some seconds before suddenly the statue's mouth opens but a different voice is heard.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gyrothos: Hm, how odd. Greetings, statue. State your business.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The statue then emits a tapping noise of sorts, as if someone is knocking on marble, but you see no one.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hello, Master Gyrothos. It's the Tapeworm. I'm stuck some kinda oubliette. Again.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There is a long pause.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gyrothos: Interesting. I understand. Will the same bargain hold from the previous.... incident?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gyrothos: A kilo of dagger, I believe it was.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Sounds fair. Thank you for your patronage.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I'm getting close to needing a kilo myself</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gyrothos: Ah, well. What level are you on? Wait, never mind, the statue probably means floor negative E. That's a rather difficult one, but a deal's a deal. I will carve you an entrance within half a day. Just need to locate the Key. Hold tight and try to keep yourself occupied.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Gyrothos: </font> [3d10 = 16]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d6 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d3 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2 = 2]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: </font> [2 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2 = 2]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: </font> [2 = 2]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: </font> [2 = 2]<br />
<font color="#261A12">After another painful wait, the Ministers suddenly hear a grinding sound, like a saw cutting through wood. A couple feet away, a door is being sawn in the floor. After a few minutes, Gyrothos's head pokes through. &#34;Second time's the charm. Oh, you have friends with you? Should have charged them as well, hahah.&#34; He wait for a response.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: waits</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (pats his pockets and shrugs): Fresh out.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis chuckles slightly</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Well, I would be happy to contribute something. You saved us! What can I do for you?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gyrothos (smiling wide): Can you spare a tooth? I have need of one for my research.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Very well. If it must be. Anyone have a knife?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Also a sewing kit and a light?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: and some pain killers?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Um... You'll probably need something with more leverage.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gyrothos: Oh, I have all of those and more back in my office, if you'd care to join me.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Oh, you carry pain killers now?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Very well. which tooth will you remove?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: I prefer a tooth noone would notice</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I propose an oral exam to determine which.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis is still lying on the floor.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gyrothos throws Scolexis a pleasing look.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gyrothos throws Scolexis a pleading look.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: with or without pain</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: so be it</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Several hours, and one less tooth (Gyrothos kindly removed a gnasher, and replaced it with an ivory alternative), later, the ministers emerge back into the the Gutter. Through sheer luck, as they do so, they hear the familiar clank of grinding metal as the chest is being opened in the distance. The Vault taketh and the Vault giveth.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis gives Zilvice a pointed look.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis points back and forth at himself and then Scolexis and finally towards the chest. He then begins to creep towards the chest to get a look at who is there.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [2d10 = 6]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d6 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d10 = 7]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice sneaks through the pipe and peeks around the corner. As he does so, his mask scrapes across the metal piping. The figure at the pile of metal sheets spins around and gets a good look at Zilvice. The figure then jets the other direction.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d10 = 5]<br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis darts after the figure</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d10 = 4]<br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis stumbles in after.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Glayjia stumbes into Zilvice</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d6 = 3]<br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn Glaygia stumbles into Zilvice</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d10 = 9]<br />
<font color="#261A12">As Zilvice gives chase, the figure turns and fires a crossbow. The bolt shears a wide tear in his pants and thunks into the granite behind him. The force of the rip throws Zilvice to the ground. The figure's footsteps can be heard in the distance but they sure are fast!</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [d10 = 3]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Whoop whoop whoop!</font><br />

<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn either from madness or her experience in The Gutter comes up with a risky yet radical idea. She speeds up and takes a tunnel to the left. Her only hope is to cut the man off ahead. As she sprints weaving through tunnels, she calls on all her power. She knew this moment was critical and had to pour her soul into this moment. Out of her throat sprang a sound both beautiful and terrifying. A call of loving death&#8217;s embrace. The passages filled with the song in all directions. While sprinting Glayjia pulls out some clothes and potions for theatrical effects. She throws a vial far ahead. From the spot smoke begins to curl and twist. Right before rounding the corner she halts and walks into the smoke in her new disguise. As the man comes running into the tunnel she slowly &#8220;Floats&#8221; out of the smoke in front of the man.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (Appearing as beautiful Death personified): REPENT!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Glayjia Baylorn: Do you fear me or love me mortal? I think it both. I can gift either but one must be chosen. To repent and confess is to accept my love. Anything else would spell a death consumed in fear and pain. Choose now.&#10;</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Glayjia Baylorn: </font> [3d10 = 22]<br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn sees The man halt. The spell works but almost too well. Like a lover catching his beloved with someone else, his instinct was to take his shank and sink it to the hilt into Glaygia&#8217;s chest, ripping through muscle and her beautiful spirit into her heart.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Glayjia Baylorn (Glaygia slowly sinks to the floor. With her last breath she whispers): Every moment holds a certainty of beauty. It is I who catch it and hold it out delicately for others to enjoy. I now pass on to you this certainty, you have destroyed beauty and accepted death&#8217;s choice to end your life in fear and pain. Perhaps not now but soon. Repent. Repent. Re..pe..n&#8230;t..</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Glayjia Baylorn eyes look to the ground into a puddle as her heart stops. She smiles. For you see, she can appear as anyone&#8217;s true love but never found her own till now. She accepts death's embrace knowing she died for the right cause.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The man, upon hearing these words, drops his knife. He falls to his knees and gently cradles Glayjia's corpse. He begins to weep. This is how Zilvice and Scolexis (holding their useless arm) find them.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis covers their mouth with the hand of their good arm. They are stunned speechless, but nevertheless tears roll down their cheeks.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (slowly approaching): Glay...Glayjia?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (Angrily grabbing at the man holding Glayjia): What did you do?!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis shakes for a moment and then reaches for the pistol bow that they keep tucked in their apron. They calmly step toward the man, raise the crossbow, and then delivers a pistol-whip to the back of their head.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2d10 = 15]<br />
<font color="#261A12">The man crumples.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (solemnly): What do we do with her body? We can't just leave her here.... Right?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis takes off their apron and lays it down on the ground.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I can pull her on this if you can help.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis they flop around their useless arm and wince.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Of course, but what about *him*</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis kicks the man on the ground</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...We'll take him to Master Gyorothos.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis looks at Zilvice.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Do... you think you'll be able to make it with me for one more trip to the Vault?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (taking a deep breath): Honestly, I'm not sure. Last trip was.... A lot.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: But if we must.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d10 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Enter Karak. He has been tailing the unconcious man and lost him in the sewer. He comes upon the scene and weapons are briefly brandished before Karak and Zilvice recognize each other. Zilvice and Scolexis had just been discussing the matter of Glayjia's body -- they desire to get to the Vermissian Vault, but wanted to make sure Glayjia's body didn't simply rot in a sewer. So Zilvice convinced Scolexis to sell it to Sister Reg, the woman who collected body parts in Red Row for Mr. Winter. Zilvice offers to bring the body there (perhaps looking for an excuse not to visit the Vault again). Karak, however, wants to learn what the man knows and offers to come with Scolexis.... it emerges that he is also working for the Ministry and their goals are aligned.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [2d10 = 7]<br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice loads Galyjia's body into a metal-lined wheelbarrow he finds outside the Gutter. He covers her in a variety of refuse from the dump.... no need to be seen carting a body around. Carting around trash isn't much better, however -- a gang of homeless scavengers descends on him about halfway and pick apart the cart despite Zilvice's attempts to keep them away. One grabs his bag, and Zilvice gives chase. By the time he returns with his posessions, the cart is empty -- even Galyjia's body is nowhere to be seen....</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak Lights a ciggarette and offers one to Scolexis.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis blinks, shrugs, and takes one.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: ...Thank you.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis doesn't take a drag, but rather watches the cherry slowly burn the cigarette down like some sort of joss stick for a memorial to the dead.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak smokes like he's got a grudge on water for being wet.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak speaks. And whenever he does, it's like a growling wolf ready to strike.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis begins frantically, almost comically looking for Glayjia. Turning over nearby garbage heaps, looking inside of dumpsters and no longer lit barrels. Finding nothing, he continues down the alley where he finds more homeless drow and begins questioning them about the scavengers who jumped him and took her body.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis , getting no answers from the homeless in the alley, Zilvice moves to find Sister Reg. The scavengers may have brought the body to her&#8230; After all, that is what he was doing.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: I've seen death. Hard death. I can't say I fear it any. I ain't ever seen The Vault. I do fear it. If you think me weak for it, I recomend you keep it to yourself. If you've got some helpful hints to not go insane, I'd like to hear it</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d4 = 1]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d10 = 1]<br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis thinks for a moment.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Try... try not to think too hard about the things that you see.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">What Zilvice doesn't know, but will soon learn, is that one of the homeless was actually working for an Aelfir lord. He dutifully reported Zilvice's clothing and mask, which the Aelfir recognized from Zilvice's durance service. His carting around a body definitely got the attention of the Aelfir. Luckily, in the next day or two Zilvice will learn from various associates that he is now expelled from anything Aelfir-related (at least, anywhere where Aelfir are normally welcome).</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">At the moment, however, Zilvice finds himself in Sister Reg's mansion, looking at puddles of blood and piles of.... flesh. Though it is often difficult to speak with Regine, Zilvice actually spots her in the &#34;corpse inbox&#34; a room over. Sister Reg doesn't seem interested in paying for the body twice.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">In the meantime, Scolexis and Karak head into The Vault....</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d10 = 5]<br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d3 = 2]<br />
<font color="#880000">Karak Doesn't shudder often but he involuntary shudders.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Tune in next time, when we discover how Zilvice handles being snubbed by Sister Reg, and whether Scolexis and Karak can convince Gyrothos to make their victim part with information.....</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Scolexis and Karak stand in a room that is brighter than they expected, for a room designed for torture. It's richly appointed, though everything in the room seems ancient -- like it was an artifact plucked from some tomb. Gyrothos has hooked the &#34;patient&#34; up to a strange device that looks like a spider made of metal. It wraps around his cranium and when Gyrothos adjusts the device, the &#34;patient&#34; grimaces and screams out in pain.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The man eventually tells you that his name is Carys. A man named Feldspar pays him to leave money in various drop points.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gyrothos: I feel he knows more than he's telling us. Perhaps he's more afraid of someone else. Or perhaps I'm having an off day. Here, you try.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">drops the winch that operates the spider device on a nearby table and collapses into a cushioned chair.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis paces.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hmm...</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (whispers to Karak): Should we Good Cop, Bad Cop this guy since he's softened up?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak grunts in response.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Never done it. Don't think I can pull off good cop.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: do you?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: I think maybe... Indifferent Cop?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis clears their throat and then turns to Carys.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Mr. Carys. I understand that you've been quite an ordeal. Could we offer you a refreshment during this respite from probing? A bit of water? A sniff of Dagger, maybe?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis shakes the Thermos.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak leans against the wall. takes a drag from his flask and lights another cig.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Carys (between deep indrawn breaths): I... I don't really do.... drugs....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: I'd offer you some liquer and a cig but I don't want you anywhere near my things.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Carys: I'll.... I'l... take a sip of water, though....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: water.. eh? Do I look like I'm made of ice? That when you snivel and whimper I'll melt?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: you'll get water when you earn it</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: that's what lifes about</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Tell me, do you like the theater Carys?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d10 = 8]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Not that I care much. I'd like to watch you hang from your heels.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: but tell me none the less</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d10 = 5]<br />
<font color="#261A12">After some back and forth, and some pointers for Gyrothos occassionally, the man breaks. He is difficult to understand at this point as he is near death, but he says something about &#34;Endline Station&#34;, and something about &#34;hell machines.&#34;It seems he's an engineer paid to work on some project at Endline Station, but the torture, plus the natyure of that work, is enough to make him near-incoherent.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gyrothos: I think he's got one more question left in him. Make it a good one. Then I'll.... clean up.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [2d10 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d3 = 1]<br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d10 = 8]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis wracks their memory. There is a pain. An unusual one -- something magical, perhaps, at the edge of memory? Unclear. The man's anguish is not entirely stemming from the torture, it seems.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis tries to shake the feeling off--figuratively, anyway.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (to Karak): Did any of that mean anything to you?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">....meanwhile at Sister Reg's....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: ... Now Miss Regine, I understand that you have already paid for this body. However, I have been wronged here and you have the oppurtunity to right said wrong. To be blunt I need the name, whereabouts or a clear description of the people who sold you this here body.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Scolexis: </font> [d4 = 3]<br />
<font color="#880000">Regine pauses what she's doing and turns to Zilvice.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Regine: And what if I said information don't come free?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: I would understand, of course. It's just that I don't think my friends in the Towers of Silence would be so understanding.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: They are so rigid in their beliefs, as you I'm sure are aware and cannot abide by what you do in the shadows of Red Row... But me... I think we could be happy business partners, if only I could find my money that you mistakenly gave to these... Ruffians.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">At the mention of the Towers of Silence, REgine bares her teeth.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [2d10 = 12]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d6 = 6]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d10 = 6]<br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis Looks at Sister Reg smugly. Sister Reg, welling with rage lunges towards Zilvice with the bone saw she was using to cut the body on her table. Zlivice, being self-assured that his coercion would sway her reacts too slowly and catches the blade across his face. Luckily for him she missed his neck as he will not be the next body to find her table&#8230; At least not today. After about half a minute of a struggle for the bone saw they separate, breathing heavily and look at each other.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis: testing!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Regine (breathing heavily): Fine. It was the Red Rat. He's with that gang, the Merkers... get out of here, and don't come back!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (Straightening his clothes and brushing himself off): Thank you, Regine. May the next time we meet be less... (slightly tilting his head) Bloody.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis leaves the shop</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Regine scowls and turns back to her work with a limp.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">... meanwhile, in the Vault, Scolexis and Karak settle on their final question: Asking what Carys knows of the connection between his group and the Weeping Maiden play. He doesn't know much beyond that Feldspar wanted them paid, regularly, in exchange for regular performances of The Weeping Maiden around Red Row.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis and Karak leave the Vault and later that day meet up with Zilvice at the cafe. There is some discussion about what to do next -- the group decides to head to Endline for some reconaissance.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Endline is not hard to find, though spatially it seems an impossible place. Scolexis guides the ministers down the large avenue that cuts through Red Row. Eventually, they pass a large stairway, decorated with crude signs and advertisements, as a sort of bulletin board. The stairway leads downwards, and a draft of hot air greets the ministers as they descend. The stair curves around in a spiral, though that doesn't seem possible -- somehow Red Row falls away behind them and they are greeted with the humid atmosphere of Endline. An ancient station, long fallen to gangs and lawlessness, it's even more dangerous than Red Row proper. Half-human howls fill the air. The station seems buzzing with activity. The clash of metal on metal can be heard. But the station is large and lbrynthine, and the abandoned shopping area before them seems empty. It's unclear where the sounds are coming from.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: huh. My kind of area.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Hm, at least there don't seem to be any Vigilites around.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Scolexis): brb bio</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: (POLL) Ready?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Let's follow the noise? Assuming it's a 'hell engine' maybe?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Sure</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: why not.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The ministers wander through endline, looking for anything suspicious. As they pass shadowy hallways, they can see fighting happening in the distance -- gang battles. Before long, the ministers realize they are picking up a retinue. Some of the drow wandering listlessly about the place appear to be converging on you. There are about a half dozen of them and they looked harmless before, but now they seem to be eyeing your property.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak grunts</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: My kind of party</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: Aw, geeze. Kinda wish we took a minute to set my arm before about to get gang-mugged.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak: (raspy shout)Anyone want a drink</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Karak (displays): his flask</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak karak wants to determine who the leader is. He actually wants someone to take a swig.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">THE SECRET OF LOOSE TONGUES</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gangbanger: I'll have the flask, but your money, too. This ain't no freeway like upspire where a drow can walk where he pleases. This is a toll road. Pay up!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: doesn't look interested in taking a swig from the flask.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gangbanger doesn't look interested in taking a swig from the flask.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: You see.. I'm a bit of a drinker. But I have such a big heart I can't help but share. If you want to dance we can dance. But I promise..</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak takes out his God Axe</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Many of you will lose your lives before I go down.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Or you can share a drink with me and if you do, I'll give you all I have.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Scolexis glances around for doors.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d10 = 6]<br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (drawing his dagger): You scum wont get anything but the tip of this dagger. I've had a very bad day and it won't end in this dump!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gangbanger: You think I'm afraid of your upspire liquor?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gangbanger walks up to Karak, toe to toe. His followers steady their weapons as they surround you.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gangbanger grabs the flask from Karak's hand at the same time as he throws a punch to Karak's gut, which he notices too late.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d6 = 5]<br />
<font color="#261A12">(Scloexis sees a door down the hall a little ways. It could be a door to the Vault, especially this being Endline.)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Gangbanger: </font> [d3 = 3]<br />
<font color="#880000">Karak keeps staring the gangbanger down</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gangbanger takes a swig from the flask, and then puts the flask in his pocket. He takes a few steps and belches.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Tell me what you know about this Hell Machine.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak reaches into his own pocket and pulls out the flask and takes a swig.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">THE SECRET OF LUCKY BREAKS</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gangbanger: This reminds me of last week. Remember lads? Those other upspire drow wandering around here like it's a friggin' tourist attraction. Gotta pay the toll! Well, they didn't want to pay. So we killed 'em! Hah! Hope you won't make the same mistake.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The ganger won't notice for some time that the flask is no longer in his pocket, but rather back in Karak's.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Find Connection</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scollexis sees the patch of the Kerberite gang, barely noticable on the ganger's rags. He recognizes the man, by reputation -- he is called The Toll Collector, famous for pulling these types of muggings. The Vault tells them that The Toll Collector is also being paid by Feldspar, and is under his employ.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Scolexis (mutters to the others): This guy's definitely on Feldspar's payroll...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: hmmm, So I wonder the connection between him and Feldspar.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Karak): Mr.winters</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Karak): Mr. Winters and Feldspar</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (quietly to the group): Maybe we should just pay the toll if he's that connected.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: So, we gonna dance boys? I've fought bigger numbers than you boy in the war with the knoll. Flee or die. My god axe is hungry...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak licks his blade from mid axe blade to tip and smiles a blood thirsty smile.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [2d10 = 15]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: How about this.. Ya heard word a few years ago of a deal with the Red Crater Gang? The case of Rust that they lost? It's in the same alley. The sewer grate. It's yours. Hellva lot more than you would get now. We can wait for a lacket to bring it back.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gangbanger considers this, but you can tell that he might have bit off more than he can chew with Karak. They expected easy pickings, and Karak ain't that.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gangbanger: You hear that, lads? These upspire scum think they can trick us out of a prize by giving us fake tipoffs. Well, we'll go check out that alley. There better be something there! If there ain't, and we see you again, we're gonna really let you have it!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gangbanger waves to his gang</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gangbanger: Let's go.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The gang retreats, swaggering, but you detect a certain... speed to their exit.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Scolexis: So. Toll paid?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Yep. I'm not happy about it but we have a greater purpose. As much as I wanted to fight.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Your info earlier.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Karak): Your previous statement..</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Karak): that's what he would say</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: It's got me thinkin'</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Think we should stalk em'. Lead us to Feldspar. Or trap. Feldspar is more likley</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak Leans against the wall, head back in contemplation. Somehow he has a fresh cig in his hand.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: I think I can follow em</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Get comftorible</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (nods): Go get 'em Karak</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [3d10 = 23]<br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [3d10 = 20]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak melts into the shadows. Zilvice and Scollexis agree to meet back at hte cafe in 24 hours. The next day, Karak reports that he tailed the gang for some time, and most of their activities were rather un-interesting. Not many people wander into Endline to get mugged. The gang looked to avoid combat with the other gangs, for the most part. Eventually they headed back to &#34;base&#34; (an abandoned newspaper stand) and began to prepare dinner. The Toll Collector  then left and Karak followed him. He went into the tunnels around Terminal 99. Karak had a difficult time following him safely into the tunnel, as there was nowhere to hide, and no noise to cover his tracks. However, even from here, he heard screams -- not of gangmembers, but of someone being tortured. The screams sound low and wheezing, like they've been going on for a long time. The Toll Collector and someone he presumes to be Feldspar speak in the darkness and a bag of coins is exchanged.</font><br />

<font color="#660066">Protector's Eye</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos takes a deep breath, assessing the situation. Her instincts consider the situation, and the man at the center of it: Feldspar. She sees a hypodermix needle, next to a beautiful, expensive wooden box. Drugs. In Red Row, its always drugs. But the case is far to expensive to be a product of a Red Row drug addict. Something else is at play here.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Neither faith, nor Drow. Underserving of mercy.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Sulphur: Pitch-black runoff from demonic incur sions, rendered down into crystals that are smoked &#10;in glass pipes. Produces a monumental rush and &#10;skews the morality of the user, so that performing &#10;unpleasant or cruel acts feels better and better the &#10;more you take. Usually tremendously expensive, &#10;the appearance of cheap sulphur is a sign of in Spire demon-summoning &#8211; which is terrible news &#10;for everyone.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alternately, it can be ground to a powder and injected, though this is typically the high-class way to consume it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: hmmmm all this chaos in Red Row over a high class drug? I don't believe it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: hmmmm... Zilvice.. You did pop ins for your aelfir yeah? I know about the Rust. Escuse me, Red Dust. Remember? They ever want Sulphur? You remeber who?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice *does* remember. Once, long ago, he had to purchase some Sulphur for his master. Sulphur is not a drug that is easily obtained. For high-ranking Aelfir like his master, it was possible, though he had to be discreet. He went to pick it up himself, from the Sisters in Threadneedle Square. Mind, it's not something they advertise -- the word Sulphur was never spoken, and a whole tea ceremony was arranged to act as a cover. Dealing sulphur is a crime that can end even the Sisters, if they are caught. If the ministers are to find it, they must figure out how to ask for it in Threadneedle Square.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">ONE OF THE STAFF</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos smoothes out the front of her silk ceremonial gown and tugs out at the sleeves so that it clings appropriately against her form. She glances about her &#34;stage&#34; as it were, and then breathes in slowly through her nose. She then abruptly shouts.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (sanctimoniously): SINNERS! CORRUPTERS! I dare you to show your faces!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos lifts her skirt so that she may dramatically kick over a pile of crates.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos screeches incoherently in the face of any bystander that is within lunging distance.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (screaming): FAITHLESS! OATHBREAKERS!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos throws herself against a building and then lets herself slip down it, while wailing.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Karak (Runs up to Zenoglos): Oh! wow. uhhh. Who is myself and myself be Woe. What have these. Oatbreakers- Sorry.. Oathbreakers- done to yee?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Think of the poor children! The wriggling, fleshy children! O woe to you of Red Row... Corrupted by the *evils* of vile Sulphur!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos flails.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: The CHILDREN!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos screams.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: AAAAHHHHAHAHAHLKASJDF;ALSJKFD'ASOFK</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: DOWN with these wretches for use of Sulphur!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The general population around Threadneedle Square hurries in any direction that can reasonably be described as *away*  from Zenoglos and Karak. They know this kind of distraught mother and know that no good will come of it.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [2d10 = 11]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d6 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d10 = 7]<br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d10 = 4]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Though the Sisters' warehouse is doing ti sbest to ignore the two, eventually, the mentions of Sulphur by name must have gotten even the Sisters attention. They send a.... squad... to deal with you. A large gnoll, and her partner, a short, wiry drow, stand in front of Karak and Zenoglos and meaningfully draw their batons.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sisters' Squad: Don't make me hit you, Midwife. Run along now and see to a clutch somewhere. We don't need your snivveling!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Sniveling they say! Hit us! Go on Kill us! We shall become marytrs! All will know of their crimes</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos poses casually on the ground.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: You heard my good companion, wretch.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: We have yet to begin to fight.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos yodels petulantly.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: You are lucky we fight with words now</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: But we know words can cut deeper at times</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: The Sisters smell of Elderberries!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: I break wind at them.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos flutters her skirt.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The squad makes a genuine attempt to avoid using their batons, but they realize that the two really won't budge. The wiry one looks at the gnoll and shrugs. The gnoll sighs and gives Zenoglos and Karak a good whack each.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak Pretends the first hit knocked him out</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (wails): I shall avenge you!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos will go limp when she's struck next.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d10 = 1]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d10 = 8]<br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d6 = 4]<br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d10 = 7]<br />
<font color="#000066">Sisters' Squad: The squad use Karak as an example for a bit, but when even physical violence doesn't work, the duo starts to get nervous. Beating defenseless midwives in the middle of the square is not really the best look, and they know it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The squad use Karak as an example for a bit, but when even physical violence doesn't work, the duo starts to get nervous. Beating defenseless midwives in the middle of the square is not really the best look, and they know it.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sisters' Squad: One last chance before we throw you in a kennel or something! Do you know who you're protesting?! The Sisters will probably turn you into tomorrow night's entertainment if you don't get lost.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Don't care. Throw us in the pitch ya lot of Sun Gazers!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (to the wiry Drow): Your broodmother would be ashaaaaaamed.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (repeats, hissing): Ashaaaaaaaamed.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The wiry drow sighs and gives pause. The gnoll gives him a look and a light tap on the knees with her baton. The drow shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Sisters' Squad: I'm sure you're right, midwife. It's too late for me, though. And now too late for you, too. You're coming with us!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The two grab a pair of legs each and drag the two protestors around the back of the building and through a loading bay in the back alley. Inside is the strangest warehouse the two ministers have yet to see. The warehouse's bottom floor is a massive set of fighting pits, and is probably menat to be busy, but givent he time of &#34;day&#34; it's empty. Elaborate stairs lead up to a second floor, which the ministers see is filled with what looks like some sort of exotic showroom -- furniture, vehicles, and art stand elaborately decorated and available for show and sale. Another set of stairs leads further up to the roof, where its said the Sisters can be found. However, they don't get to experience the sights for long before they are thrown into a dingy closet. The duo goes off to find someone of authority who can decide what to do with them next.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (pleasantly): Well. That went smashing.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak Sighs</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: They hit like broodlings</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Lights a match and with it a cigarette</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak lights a match and with itg a cigarette</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: The only wound I've to tend is my pride.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Zilvice prepares for his ruse by practicing his aelfir etiquette&#8230; It has been a while since he has attended such a highly formal event. Putting on his formal attire, a black pinstripe suit, and fitting his servants mask onto his face he makes for the service door.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis knocks on the door, straightening his suit jacket.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (hisses from the other side): Shaaaame...!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis finds himself inside and begins to look for the head of service to find what jobs he can attend to while keeping an eye out for Karak and Zenoglos&#8230; Or at least where they may be brought so he may break them out. While inside, getting his assignment he overhears a wiry drow complaining about a couple of &#8216;do gooders&#8217; locked in a closet downstairs. He slips away and begins his descent to find his companions.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis walks into the warehouses bottom floor. Seeing the fighting pits stirs foul memories of seeing his drow companions and sometimes even friends drugged and thrown in to fight to, often times, their death. Shaking the memories from his head he follows the angry sounds coming from the door across the aisle.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis walks up to the door and tries to open it</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Coat?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Plenty in here</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (somewhat surprised that the door was only held by a chair): Hello there...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: I do hope you brought us a pair of uniforms. Unless the ruse is unnecessary?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: I'm sure there's something in here for us to wear.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (pausing): Sadly no... But I do have these</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis holds out tray of crudites</font><br />

<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (hushed): There is a laundry room back there if you'd like to follow me... In the meantime act like you belong here eh?</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: right</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Zenoglos: Maybe we should stick around and act like a pair of good little troublemakers?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos reaches for another veggie stick.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Zenoglos: *nom*</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: Let's get going</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Zilvice Baen-duis: I'd agree.... But isn't whoever threw you in here going to come back for you two?</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: Yeah?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (shaking head slightly): Sorry, I meant that more to Zenoglos. We should move quickly and quietly...</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (wistfully): As you wish.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos stands up and dusts herself off, smoothing out the front of her dress.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis looks around and starts towards the laundry room</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos removes her shoes and follows.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: Follows</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak follows</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: Alright, so we matching costumes?</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Zenoglos: I suppose I posing as a debutante and one of you being my valet would attract too much attention?</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: I'll dress as a hired thug. Might as well. I won't fit in otherwise</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis leads Karak and Zenoglos to the Laundry room and acts as a lookout while they find appropriate clothing.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak Pulls various articles of clothing and throws on a suitable outfit</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [3d10 = 15]<br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [3d10 = 12]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [2d10 = 16]<br />
<font color="#261A10">Zilvice and Zenoglos successfully make it to the laundry room. Karak is bringing up the rear, and just as he is passing a doorway, it opens to reveal one of the gang members that had initially captured him. He only sees Karak, so Zilvice and Zenoglos reach the laundry room several doors down without being seen.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">The gang member immediately slams into Karak, attempting to shock him by slamming him into the wall behind him.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d6 = 4]<br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [d10 = 1]<br />
<font color="#660066">Martyr</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d6 = 5]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d10 = 8]<br />
<font color="#261A10">.... the fog of time swirls us back several seconds....</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos feels a keening in the weave of reality... Mother Ishkrah guides her actions, and although the way is clear to her it is as though it were a dream. In that mortal instant she saw Karak die from blunt trauma to the head; a lucky shove and a jutting metal fixture were the cause. Instead, she pivoted on the balls of her bare feet and pushed her comrade out of the way--the gang member instead plowed her backward into the selfsame wall that claimed Karak. Thankfully, the priestess was several inches shorter and only struck the back of her head against the stone wall--a ringing blow, but not fatal.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos slides down the wall dazed.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">There is a moment of confusion as the gang members isn't sure what just happened and can't seem to decide whether to yell or strike Zenoglos.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: *gang MEMBER (singluar)</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak Karaks vision turns red and he pulls out his axe and charges the gang member. A need for blood pulsing in his heart</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [3d10 = 20]<br />
<font color="#880000">Karak His axe thunks into and through the mans neck, consuming and digesting the mans soul.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak blood shoots up from the mans neck and hits he walkway above.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: Zenoglos, are you alright</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos blinks and winces.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak holds his hand out</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos groans as she reaches out to pull herself up.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Zenoglos: Let's... do what we planned to.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak helps Zenoglos up</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: I owe you one.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos puts a hand to the wound on her head.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (quietly): I'll put it on your tab.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: Don't have a tab. No need to go to bars when my flask always has a sip in it</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">The ministers hurry into the laundry room and quickly put on some convincing outfits.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: After we finish changing can you patch me up a bit?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Canticle of Remaking</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: I think they cracked a rib</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos quietly clears her throat and then breaks out into some tradtional Drow throat singing.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak lLooks around</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos first treats Karak.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: actually I think we can all use some help</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [3d10 = 16]<br />
<font color="#005500"> (Zenoglos): make that Zilvice.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: The drug peddling murdering scum got what he deserved. Feels good.</font><br />

<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [3d10 = 16]<br />

<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d6 = 1]<br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos frowns at her serving clothes.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Zenoglos: I need a drinking.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Zenoglos: Lots of the drinking.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Blessing of Ishkrah</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [3d10 = 11]<br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (sighs): We have to clean this up before someone sees this... Karak, grab the body... Zeno, help me over here</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [4d10 = 30]<br />
<font color="#880000">Karak karak finds a handy closet to store the body</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos hums quietly and tunelessly as she soaks up blood from between the grout and is pleased by the capillary action.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: You see that Lemon? Lemon is great for cleaning blood. Just grab that bucket and water</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: and sqeeze that lemon in</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: SCENE</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">The ministers wander the premises on various &#34;errands&#34; and tasks, surriptiously looking for where the Sulphur might be stored. Eventually, the three get together to compare notes and agree that there is a room that none of them could check: It's on the roof, an actual metal structure, like a roof shed, of sorts. The room is always being guarded by two guards. They suspect the drugs are there.... now.... how to gain access to it....</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Eyes of Ishkrah</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [4d10 = 24]<br />
<font color="#880000">Karak lurks in a shadow listening for guards who are on their way to change into guard gear and releive those up top. He matches therewalking rythm and notices them enter a locker room. Karak cracks his neck. Takes a swig. Uses the back of his hand to wipe his mouth. Lights a cig. He opens the door and says</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: Heya fellas. This is fist. Fist likes faces and smashing them. Come and get aquanted</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos spent all of her time looking for a way to clamber up high so she could actually drop kick one of the guards...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak or in this case, not Karak. A Guard ready for his shift walks up several flights of stairs. A trail of smoke following him. He walks up to the guards and grunts</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: We here to releive ya.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak Waps one of the guards in the face.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Karak): doesn't wap them in the face</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak slips into the room once the old guards leave. Inside is a a treasure trove of drugs. Everything is neatly organized in metal jars that are neatly labelled. There is a scroll next to each jar listing deposits and withdrawls.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak takes a quick read of the notes</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos keeps her flailing to herself as an idea occurs to her.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Zenoglos: Ooo! Ooo! Dump all the powdery ones!When we waft the door shut I want you to throw a lit cigarette inside!</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Karak: Good idea. But I'mma spill em all in a pile so we destroy everything.</font><br />
<font color="#261A10">Zenoglos: But pocket the Sulphur. We need our leverage after all... The Ministry can keep it safe or have a better idea of what to do with it.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak spills everything but the powders into a pile on the ground</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak pockets the Sulphur</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak empties the powder, lights a cig and places it adjacent to the powder. Then walks out.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Karak: </font> [3d10 = 12]<br />
<font color="#261A10">The ministers rapidly descend the stairs. A series of soft cracks and booms are heard, followed by some screams and raised voices, commands thrown around, and then more booms and the sound of some sort of spell being cast. As the ministers emerge into the thick Red Row air and discard their costumes, they scurry away from the warehouse. They can barely make out the silhuettes of the Sisters as they scream bloody murder. Several people are seen being thrown off the roof.</font><br />

<font color="#005500">GM: (POLL) Ready?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">MASK OF PLENTY [Occult]</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos clutches the Ministry's misbegotten gains in her hands and chuckles. Her shoulders shake and then her head rears in a machiavellian laugh.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (with a dramatic flourish): Witness! The birth of a new legend!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos points at Zilvice.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (aside to Karak): No offence to you, Mr Bloody Bound--Bloodbound?--but I think our good Masked Minister here is perfect for the next phase of our plan. Which I like to call... &#34;Operation: Kingpin.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos goes on to outline a risky plan of using a false persona portrayed by Zilvice, wherein he becomes a fallen half-aelfir bastard; a scion of wealth of prestige who has come to Red Row with precious Sulphur to curry favour with the local crimelords.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: But of course with the intention of betraying each and everyone of them in turn. Starting with our good Mr. Winter. News of the havoc we caused at the Sisters' should be stale right now. Anyone smart will already be planning to stick them while they're on their backfoot. Thoughts?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: By Craters and light. That's so insane it might acidently work. I have no doubt The Sisters will try very hard to kill us.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak takes a puff</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Good thing you've got me then to cover your asses</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: You know the number one way to avoid death as a drug lord? Lots of underlings with weapons and money. We don't have any of that</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos 's lips split into a wide, wicked grin.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Mayhap our Vigilite connection can be useful... As in... I dunno. Curry a rumour that the Sisters were filthy aelfir collaborators and need to be put out of their misery?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: But damn it sounds like my kind of fun</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: That, I doubt. Our organisation wants to play a quiet long game. They would rather cut our throats... Now that I think about it.... I really do wonder what theuy think about this..</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (demurely): Who better to convince them than a winsome midwife and her concern for her *darling* charges?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: I'll get to looking up muscle. There are people who owe me favors that aren't friends. Maybe it's time I ask them to help. Either by joining or by paying for someone else to join.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos begins street preaching of the moral decay of Red Row and how the misfortune of the Sisters' speak of righteous forces at work, punishing them. She speaks that through the visions in the webs sent to her by Ishkrah have foretold of an unlikely champion to bring deliverance to all her children. She harasses the Vigil, spurring them to turn their wrath on the sisters. She goes on tantrums outside of the haunts of Mr. Winter's men, calling them out to smite, and hinting that a &#34;certain man&#34; would be willing to ally with him. She screeches in the markets and outside of the Orphanarium that a new power is rising, and all should welcome him.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Karak winds through the dark alleys like a nightmare in the shadows. Those who glimps him seldom dare to look back. When one glimpses death personified ones only option is to fain ignorance. He reaches the rear of a church and slaps the door twice and follows with two quick knocks. &#34;Polter. It's time to pay me back for all those times I saved your ass in the war. Plus, I've got a baggie of moondust I've been collecting. Not the big boys but perhaps enough to finish that diarama you've been working on? You convince some of your pals to work under me for a week and you owe me nothin. Hell maybe I'll owe you one.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis seeks out Vorn Mur&#8217;ss, former hand servant to Qinrel. Once found he asks Vorn if he has heard of this new &#8220;Mr. North&#8221;&#8230; &#8220;He has been starting to make waves in the sulfur trade and would probably be one to keep an eye out for if one had any interest in such&#8230; Affairs&#8221; Vorn has, unsurprisingly not heard of Mr. North but will ask around for more information. Zilvice leaves with one last warning &#8220;Be careful Vorn, I hear he is very dangerous&#8230; Tread lightly.&#8221;</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">The ministers disguise themselves and set up shop in Red Row, installing Zilvice as the &#34;drug kingpin&#34; who is the only one in Red Row who currently has access to Sulphur. Karak and his hired thugs are the muscle that guards the operation, and Scolexis parlays her reputation into marketing the operation.&#10;&#10;You do a brisk trade for a day or two, but the Sisters' goons arrive about as quickly as expected. Karak and the guards manage to hold them off for some time but Karak takes a bad club hit to his leg, and bones crack. He is out of commission for now.&#10;&#10;Zilvice goes undetected for the time being, which is good because he has made quite a reputation in Aelfir circles and the primary purchasers of Sulpher are Aelfir -- at least through their drow intermediaries.&#10;&#10;Eventually, Mr. Winter makes good on his bargain and the troubles brewing between him and the Sisters distract attention from your enterprise. Winter's taxes continue to rise as the gang war begins to fully boil over. The ministers' time is limited.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Time to decide how to make use of this enterprise while it lasts...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Three days later, and the carpet-encrusted, richly decorated (for drug lords, anyway) hovel that Mr. Winter leases you is mostly empty. Karak, his leg bound in a splint, lounges on the roof, overlooking the permeter. Zenoglos has just returned from a negotiation with Winter about how much of the proceeds he is owed. And Zilvice sits in the makeshift throne, having just dispensed a minim of Sulpher to a drow servant clearly used to trips to Red Row. It's time to figure out what's next....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Ought I rewrite the histories of some randos so that they are inextricably connected? Some sort of... J'uliett and Ro'me'o Of-the-clear-boundless-sky situation?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Weave the Web</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos paces about slightly, then pauses, posing in thought.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: On the other hand... I suppose I can tie someone closer to home together with another, more distance acquaintance or rival.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Who do you have in mind? Feldspar? The Sisters?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos grunts slightly.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: I think we're already tied too close to the Sisters for comfort...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Now if we had a convenient *rube*...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos rubs her hands together conspiratorially.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Boy-oh-boy.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: hmmmm just set Feldspar up with Koreen. I have good reason to believe she is a spy from The Sisters. shit heads like her aren't skilled enough not to leave clues lying around.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Use Koreen to force Feldspar to choose between drugs and his new found love interest.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Either way. Win for us.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos nods appreciatively.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There is a jingle-jangle of bells from the doorway of the hovel as a customer pokes their head in. The guards wave him through. Zilvice can see the fear in his eyes behind the white-and-purple striped mask. Another buer for another rich Aelfir lordling.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: *buyer</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Customer: Excuse me, I hope I... am not interrupting....</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos does a casual and completely normal hair flip.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: By the way I've got to go into hiding while my leg heals. &#34;Our friends&#34; are sending someone to help. Only glimpsed them. I can only descibe them as Beautiful Death. So glorious yet terrifying. And I don't spook easy. Names' Borel Bellgivh</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (leans back in &#34;throne&#34; and gestures to buyer): Who are ya here for and whatd'ya want?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Customer: Uhhhhhh what....? Oh, yes. Right. Um. I would like to purchase some.... Sulpher.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos nonchalantly admires her nails.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (leans forward, putting his weight onto his elbow and says slowly and slightly annoyed sounding): How. Much. Do. You. Want... My timid little friend?</font><br />

<font color="#005500"> (Karak): Mr. Smiles</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Zenoglos): Sister Soldier</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (snaps his fingers and says mockingly): Mr. Smiles, get the man *one sulpher*!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak Grunts and painfully gets to his feet. Then he draws out a tiny pouch and hands it to the customer. then holds out his hand for payment.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (motions towards Zenoglos): Cash over that way. You wouldn't mind, would'ya Sister?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos demurely saunters over to the cash pile and awaits reception of payment. She affects sexy boredom.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The masked drow shakily hands over his money and departs with the drugs, leaving as hurriedly as decorum would allow. This leaves the den empty once more and ready for more planning.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos studies herself.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Hmp. Needs more cleavage, if we're going to keep this up.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos gives herself a &#34;boob wedgie&#34; with the front of her gown.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Hmp.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d100 = 36]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [2d10 = 8]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d6 = 1]<br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos is in back room of the hovel, holding two crudely rendered figurines made of 'felted' spider's silk that are roughly humanoid in form. She rises them up toward the ceiling and begins her suplications to Ishkrah so that Koreen and Mr Winter's lives would become inextricably linked.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos winces as the arcane energies back feed into her, surging like a dagger in the back of her skull. She falls to her knees, dropping the two figurines--the spell failed.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (chuckles bitterly to herself): Fair enough... but I think Ishkrah knows that I'm more stubborn than most of her faithful...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos lets out a small frustrated snarl and then goes back to the 'throne room'.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: It was a bust.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Unless you have another pair of shlubs you want me to try?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Eh, I guess we won't know untill we confront Fardspel</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Karak The door opens and a pale drow seems to float into the room.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Iiiii ammmmm Borel. Iiii comeeee to aid.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Iiiii ammmmm Borel. Iiii comeeee to aid.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (quietly and to herself): So spoopy...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Zenoglosss. A particular pleassureee to be graccced by your spirit once again.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: We are grateful for the aid and succor that you have graciously elected to provide for us.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos bows at the waist respectfully.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (nods): Zilvice... You two know each other then?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh: you hear the thuds of four large paws and claws walking in from the shadowed hallway. A hyena that looks like it could swallow a mans foot in a quick slap walks in. However, what's scarier is seeing inteligence behind it's eyes and in its deminor. Everything it does has a purpose. It nods at each of you.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Thisss issss Tollzzzz</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: My faithful companion and friend.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Karak: Nice to officially meet you Borel, Tollzzz. I hope we meet again but I need rest. Good luck all.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: Heal quickly Karak....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: And be sure to keep that other leg of yours in tact. We'll be seeing you.</font><br />

<font color="#005500"> (Borel Bellgivh): Hyena name Tollz</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos un-boobwedgies herself and curtseys half-seriously to the group.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh Borel Contacts Wark. A follower of his Sage order. He asks him for Cackle of his strongest Hyena's for a short time.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Pray excuse me, My Lord North. I shall hopefully return with a retinue of devout midwives.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos departs for her abbey to appeal to Mother Arcanali for her half-baked plan... But not before attempting to enlist the aid of one Sister Britta'xant, who would natural be a barrier to such unscrupulous musings.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (nods): Gods speed</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos returns to the place secretly known as the &#34;Thousand-Thousand Eyes&#34;, now normally fronted as a legitimate shine to Limy&#233;. Not pausing once to greet or bow or show other acknowledgement to her erstwhile 'sisters', she instead homes in on one particular nun: Sister Britta'xant, whom she finds soon enough in the middle of tea.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos petulantly throws herself upon Britta, nearly squealing in a petulant wine.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Brittaaaaa...! Help...!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos smirks as she causes the other nun to spit and choke on her tea.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos pleads and whines, and poorly describes her situation and in a dramatic and put-down fashion. All done in a very high childish voice, complete with aggravated stomping and kneeling while tugging on the woman's habit.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (again in that voice...): So pwetty pwease? Help me see the Abbess?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos makes a pouty face.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos had worn Britta down exactly as planned. Taking her by the cuff, she runs toward the cloister dragging Britta long to confront the Abbess. Though in the holy woman's presence, she remembers her manners and then recounts the noble situation of one &#34;Mr North&#34; who dares to fight the corrupt drug lord Feldspar, and has even enlisted the help of Mr Winter in their cause. All they need is a show up with a superfluity of Midwives in a parade of solidarity.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Jussst impart a location and a torrent of hyenas will arrive to eat.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh Informs Wark to send the hyenas to End Line Station.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Shall we depart for End Line?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh arrives with Tollz at End line.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: What sssay you Tollz. Do you sssmell the dew of deeath in the air? Go, Vanish and Scout the location in my mind. I shall be right behind you. Return to me when you have finished</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh: Tollz Gives a small yet excited Yap and speeds off. His footsteps start as thunder but turn to the padding of rat feet. You watch as Tollz sinks into the shadows.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos 's endless innane pleadings and supplications eventually wore the Abbess down. Having aprized the situation, Mother Arcanali had permitted two score of their order's nuns for the endeavour. At her request, they all began to warm up their voices and practice their harmonies before leaving the abbey...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos: The superfluity is heard before they are seen. They arrive at End Line singing a haunting hymn as they marched through Red Row.</font><br />

<font color="#005500">GM: (POLL) Ready?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Picture this: A tall archway, studded with ancient wiring and broken lights, covers a long railline that recedes into the dark unknown. A huddle of midwives chant as the proceed through the arch -- alone they would fear the dark, here in the Underspire, but together they know none would dare touch them. Or at least none among their own people. As they pass through the arch, a voice calls out: &#34;Hark, midwives of Spire and spinners of the web that we all praise. Go no further. What is your aim here? There are no hatchlings here, I assure you.&#34; The speaker remains unseen and the voice booms out from the dark tunnel.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos glances to Britta as a signal to halt and continue their song. She steps toward Tollz's side and glances up at Zilvice, awaiting some sort of cue for the song to cease.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis raises his right hand slowly, while trying to seem in control and not at all struggling to keep on top of Tollz. As his hand reaches about eye level he suddenly closes it to a fist. The midwives cease the song in sync.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh a low grow is heard in all directions</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis looks at Zenoglos, gently nudges his head towards the source of the voice.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (says quietly): Would you like to address them or should I?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos nods, indicating that she will speak. She takes a step forward, inhaling through her nose deeply so that she may boom in her most shrill and offended voice.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (shrilly and offended): INSOLENT CHILD! Blasphemer, and tempter of our people! You who idolize pleasures of the flesh to that of your kindred! You would speak thus to we and yours? Quiet thine tongue and hark to the noble man who would be your undoing!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (quietly, she motions to Zilvice): My lord.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There is a pause as this rebuke is processed.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d10 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d6 = 4]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d10 = 6]<br />
<font color="#000066">Voice (with strained patience): Mothers, I will be patient with you, but you trifle with your betters. You are not in the hatchery, and help is far away. State your business or turn around.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Voice: There will be no third warning.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [4 = 4]<br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh In an evil snake like voice with his cackle of hyenas drawing in.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Feldddsssparrrrr. We commme to bring you an offer. Disband your goals and influence in Red Row. Tell us your motive. Then leave. In return, you recieve a substantial amount of Sulphur (All that is left in Red Row as a matter of fact), and keeping your spine attached to your meat and bones. My babies are hungry.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">CACKLE</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh Right on queue and at the same time, Borel and Tolzz begins to yap and snap their jaws, foam falling in globs from their mouths. Then to the right, another yap. Then to the left, another. One by one the hyenas join in to build a chorus of cackles, laughs, yaps, and the sounds of teeth knawing. Death has come and it will be slow and ultimatly painful.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Borel Bellgivh: </font> [d3 = 1]<br />
<font color="#660066">Borel Bellgivh: </font> [3d10 = 19]<br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Voice: This isn't Feldspar. He is too busy for such trivialities. But, yes, mothers, your fiersome beasts are rather...disturbing. I shall strike a bargain with you. Return to your hatcheries, and I shall inform Feldspar that his new package has been located. He will surely be pleased at this news and will come visit you immediately. Pray tell, where can these hatcheries be found?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (Speaking abruptly and with power): You will cease addressing the mothers and address me, Mr. North. For I am the reason the mothers have come. I am the reason these fearsome beasts surround you now. I am the reason the Sisters are hurting so... So now, come out from the shadows so that we may speak freely.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [2d10 = 12]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d6 = 6]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zilvice Baen-duis: </font> [d10 = 5]<br />
<font color="#660066">Martyr</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d6 = 6]<br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The voice notices who made these demands -- and they know that it's Zenoglos! Through magic or trickery, you know not, it is Zenoglos's name and face that are reported to the Red Row mercenary gangs later this everning. Though the ministry pays the gangs off to avoid more trouble, they decide to Burn Zenoglos. This will come to fruition later....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">... in the meantime....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There is a thumping sounds a whistle, and footsteps resound fromt he tunnel. Four men emerge, equipped with professional soldiering gear and balaclavas. They stop about thirty feet away, just barely withing the fading light coming from outside the tunnel.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Voice: Well, here we are.... Mr. North. I'm afraid there's not much we can do to help you without Feldspar.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Protector's Eye</font><br />
<font color="#660066">LAY OF THE LANDS</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos studies the owner of the Voice whom they have been speaking with since they arrived. She squints, studying the man behind the balaclava, probing primal feelings and emotions...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos now understands: There is a man, the fourth of the four standing before you -- smaller, skinnier, and standing slightly behind the other three -- it's the leader's brother. He values him above all else.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh takes the three or four seconds he has to assess the situation. 1. How to gain a fighting advantage. 2. Where is the nearest exit. 3. Is there something in the environment that can help kill these men.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh Sees that only the two in the front were carrying swords...and.. hmm what can that bulge be? But the two in back only had switch blades. Strick with hyenas in the rear to confuse then strike from the front.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Sees what looks like scavenger tunnels bored over a long time the go through the cement walls.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh Sees what looks like scavenger tunnels bored over a long time the go through the cement walls.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh Spots an electrical wire.. Hm Yes! Tell everyone to stay off the rail and electrify the rail? mmmmmm Yum. Cooked man meat for Tolz.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (to Zilvice): Begging your pardon, My Lord...</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (smiling, to the leader): Tell me, underling... if I were to command the cackling horde in the shadows to say... pounce upon that fellow over there.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos points at the leader's brother.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Would that perchance earn us an audience with your master?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh: A few hyena yaps cry out</font><br />
<font color="#660066">SIGIL OF OUR WRATHFUL LADY</font><br />
<font color="#660066">CACKLE</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Borel Bellgivh (whispered): Tolllllzzz. Hehe.Heheheeeee. It's timeee to bring more souls to Charnel. Go ahead Sic' 'em boy!The Leaderss brother.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh gives his Preyhook one good twirl and goes to hook the man in the thigh</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Fetch</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Borel Bellgivh: </font> [2d10 = 11]<br />
<font color="#261A12">As Tolz darts out to grab the brother, one of the soldiers snaps around and sinks a blade into Tolz's thick fur.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Borel Bellgivh: </font> [d6 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Borel Bellgivh: </font> [d6 = 4]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Tolz growls and sinks his fangs into the brother's leg as he twists around. Faliling, he slams to the ground as the rest of the soldiers turn. Tolz darts into the shadows. The cracking of bone can be heard between the borther's shrill yelps. The leader yells out a gutteral scream of rage and charges into the darkness after the beast.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Oh dear. It would seem that negotiations have broken down.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The other soldiers appear to be unsure what to do next.... they appear to not want to turn their backs to the Wives (and Ministers) but are alarmed at their leader's reaction.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos looks to Zilvice.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (Shouting): Stop! Mr. Smiles, stay your blade! YOU! *pointing at the man in charge* Give us what we have asked of you and your man will live. If you wish, however, to continue this madness I am sure Mr. Smiles will be more than happy to give your man a smile so wide he will never be the same again.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Hehehehehe</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Soulsssss don't smile</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The leader runs through the darkness but stops short when he hears Zilvice. He turns to see his brother in  Borel's grip.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Voice: Scoundrels! Let him go! Ask what you want of me, but I cannot help you stop Feldspar's madness! For your own sakes, I say, leave this be! Let my brother go! Kill him and I swear I will hunt you.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Tells ussss of this madnessssss. Why the spell on the play?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Voice growls with frustration and stares into his brother's eyes as he replies.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Voice: I do not know anything about a spell. I know Feldspar was paying those performers to put on their nonsense. He wants the chaos, don't you see? He wants Red Row to boil over with it. He's using it to power his.... contraptions.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zilvice Baen-duis: What contraptions?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Voice jerks a thumb towards the tunnel behind him, where he came from.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Voice: They're in there. They make you go crazy. It spoke to me of tesselation and the unbroken rhythym. Of blood and acid. I tell you.... walk away.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">He spits the last two words, glancing at you and away from his brother for a moment, then his gaze returns.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Then tell us all you know of these machines. how many guard them? Weak points on destroying them? Then Run far far away from here. We will take care of Feldspar and these machenes</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Voice: We were the only guards. It was meant to be a small operation. I don't know anything about destroying them, but you would be doing the world a favor. Feldspar didn't build them, not really. There's a corpse in the pile of trash about three hundred feet north up this track. He was one of the prisoners who helped Feldspar. There were others like him. They would be of more use than me.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos takes this moment of bantering to cast a spell...</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Eyes of Ishkrah</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [3d10 = 13]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d6 = 1]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos nearl doubles over backwards as the webs spiral out from the station. These are wrong webs  not just the magic, which can be right, in its own way.... but just.... wrong. Each strand jitters like a chain of dying gnats, and the webs spiral outwards like an umbrealla, cloaking all of Red Row behind and ahead of you. The center of the web, where the jitter is thickest, and wrongest, is in the station beyond the darkness from which the soldiers came, and where Karak saw Feldspar speaking with the gang leader. Before the spell fades, Zenoglos can see that there actually *three* centers to this web... like three overlapping umbrellas.</font><br />

<font color="#005500">GM: (POLL) Ready?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Eyes of Ishkrah</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">A subway tunnel. The ministers stand within one, half-built, with sparking wires and broken and warped rails. It was never used, one of the stations of the failed Vermission Project, a station tethered to the physical world. Now abandoned, this and many other stations are hives for those who do not wish to be found. The ministers have finally tracked Feldspar, creator of chaos in Red Row, to this particular station. The ministers stand in the tunnel, having subdued the station guards. The lit station &#34;lobby&#34; where passengers were meant to wait, lies ahead -- the source of the occult magical signal revealed by Zenoglos.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Having found what they were looking for, the ministers dismiss the beaten guards and their captured brother. Likewise, Zenoglos tells the midwives she will meet them back at the drug den headquarters. They nod, knowingly. The ministers carefully approach the station. Beyond, further down the tracks past the station, they see the pile of scrap and garbage that the guards said contained a body they might be interested in. Their eyes quickly dart to the station itself as they hop onto the cracked ceramic. The station was meant to be beautiful, once -- before the Aelfir came. A vast mural of some ancient god decorates the floor, broken into tens of thousands of small ceramic shards. There are torches all around the station, as well as many voluminous cloth walls hastily erected to form a sort of building. The ministers tear aside some of these, weapons at the ready, but there doesn't seem to be anyone here. Finally, Zenoglos indicates that they've reached the first of the three occult magic sources. Zilvice pulls the cloth aside, revealing a strange contraption -- a metal chair with sigils and glowing runes inscribed upon its arms and back. A man sits in the chair but seems unaware of you. Blood trickles slowly from his mouth. He breathes shaky breaths and twitches occassionally.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: SCENE: Investigate Feldspar's Headquarters</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos studies the victim.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The man is strapped into the chair with leather belts. He looks old -- perhaps almost 200 years old. He is clothed in a robe. His hands are soft, not those of a laborer. His robe is caked with blood and sweat.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Not a way for the soul to leave. Eaten, it is, by nothing worthy.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: And slowly</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: He seems to be in no immediate danger... Dare I attempt something reckless to free him? He very well may die in the attempt--due to mine ignorance, of course.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos flexes her fingers at the ready to do something reckless.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Your health should stay intact I think.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos stands up straight and assume a more thoughtful posture.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Hm, but methinks that there are still three more such potential victims... we may be able to glean more by finding them first. They very well be some... occult gestalt of some sort.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: agreeeeed</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Looking around the station, it is fairly easy to find the remaining two sources of magic. The situation is very similar with them -- old drow, same exact robes as the first. Bad shape. Blood coming from the mouth, twitching every once in a while.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos pauses in thought; silently and unmoving for a moment. Then she thumps a fist into her palm.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Well, I do suppose that this is just the sort of situation that calls for recklessness.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Shall we remove them from the chairs at the same time?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Precisely my thinking. Let's undo the straps first before we do.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carefully, the three ministers undo the straps holding down the old drow. Then, on the count of three, they pull them off of the chairs at the same time, placing them on cots that were stacked in a corner of the station. The twitching stops when they are removed from the chairs. They begin to moan and cough and wake up, slowly.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (totally lacking in delicacy): Well! Aren't you all fortunate that there were three of us here.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Ancient Drow 1: Come for more, have ye? Ye best dust the fiddle now, 'fore it fiddles no more. The hungry deep will reach us, soon, and teeth will crack. Let me sleep.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The other two begin to nod their assent and agreement upon hearing this, apparently understanding.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos half-shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Was that a request to return you to whatever awful fates you had resigned yourselves to? Well, I suppose that was our fault for interpretting the situation thus. But before we consign you to said fate, would you kindly exposit what this all is for?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The men stare at you for some time in silence. Eventually one speaks.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Ancient Drow 2: This mother is not from the same brood as the bastard child. Mother asks for a story. Mother believes we like being far from the hungry deep. Mother has misunderstood.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Ancient Drow 3: Stories, we are poor in stories. Too much noise here. The hungry deep calls for us. The bastard child stole us from the deep, raising us to the cacaphony of this wretched hole. The hungry deep fought. The hungry deep lost. The hungry deep always loses, at first.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Over time, the ministers begin to make some sense of these rambles. They begin to understand that these three are prisoners of Feldspar, taken in a raid of some sort from somewhere below Red Row. There were four of them, but the fourth is probably the corpse the guard told you about.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: *you=the ministers </font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos scratches her head.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Huh. Didn't think we'd have an intersection of a culture clash *and* an generational gap working against us.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos begins to meander, looking for that elusive hypothetical fourth chair.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: These do not look like machines or engines. Perhaps metaphor has been used? Yes?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos does eventually find a fourth &#34;cubicle&#34; of sorts that is the same shape as the others, but there is no chair inside. However, nearby there is a stack of what the ministers assumed to be firewood, but upon closer examination appears to be the same wood panels that make up the chairs. Some have the runes burned into them, but not all. A chair under construction, perhaps? Abandoned when the proposed &#34;owner&#34; was killed?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [2d10 = 9]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: May I recomend a coursssse? Assskethhh a man not our blood but trusted all the sssame to resst upon a chair?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos makes a face.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Do we have such a person?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: I knowss a few Drowss but ask of them this task would not be advisable. They have other usssses.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Perhaps we can provide coin to a beggar?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos makes a limp-wristed &#34;pshaw&#34; gesture.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Nonsense. We have a willing Minister right here.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: And *this* one has a notion or two...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos begins sifting through the discarded bits.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: ah... Perhaps you missssed all the blood?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos chuckles to herself.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: There is quite a bit on their person</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: &#34;Subvert rather than destroy.&#34; That's our mission, is it not?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: So just watch me.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos uses what she has observed of the occult symbols on the chairs and her own theory and understanding of how the chairs work to create not only a working duplicate of one, but one that may act as a control terminal between the set and whatever they're connected to.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Your fangs are sharp and your brood plentyful Zenoglos. I know few other mothers with hairs like yours</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (absently): You're too kind, he-who-welps-feliform-carnivores...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">After some time, the project is complete. The old drow were helpful, to a degree, when Zenoglos had made small mistakes in burning on the runes. Now the chair sits in its place and seems to almost thrum with an anticipatory energy.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: I prefer He-Who-Guides-Essence-Onward but take your complimenttt I ssshall</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: hehehe</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Ancient Drow 1: The mother will make the dust collect upon the bastard, perhaps? This would bring a brief solace to the hungry deep.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos giggles into a snort.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Oh dear. What a terrible, wonderful mistake I'm about to make.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: I shall try to guide you in a worst case scenario</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (nods): We'll pull you off should it go wrong</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos sits in the chair. Immediately, she feels dark, grasping tendrils reach into brain. Reflexively, she leaps out of the chair and the tendrils recede. Blood pounds in her veins as the feeling fades.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos mutters curses.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Now I wonder if this was meant to be a burden shared...</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Ancient Drow 1: The hungry deep draws forth the dust. The leather must be placed over the limb. The body must be restrained.  The hunger must be allowed to feed.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos frowns then sighs.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Well, I've committed *this* much to the bit already...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Looks like you boys will just have to hold me down and strap me in.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: I hasss chaainnnnnssss</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zilvice Baen-duis (in earnest): Are you sure?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh ties Zenoglos down with the chains of his prey hook</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zilvice Baen-duis helps tie Zenoglos to the chair</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Zenoglos (after a drawn-out pause): No. But I will do it anyway.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos offers a reassuring wink.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh puts a hand on Zenoglos's  shoulder and nods.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d10 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d6 = 5]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d10 = 4]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos sits int he chair once more, and before she can leap up, Zilvice and Borel whip a chain around her midsection, tying her down. They wrap the chain around several times until Zenoglos's twitching subsides. In her mind, Zenoglos has succumbed to the tendrils -- they reach inside her mind, eating away at thoughts and memories. The tendrils seem to seek a target, a particular desire or connection. Zenglos attempts to force the tendrils to a particular thought, but she does not know the technique. The old drow watch her and nod sagely as her mind begins to be consumed. Blood pours from her nose and mouth. The machine has done something -- is doing something. But once blood is flowing freely and Zenoglos's veins begin to pop out of her skin, Zilvice and Borel undo the chains and pull her out.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Ancient Drow 2: Welcome to the hungry deep, young mother. From dust were you born, and to dust shall you return. Drink in the peace of knowing that you shall be one with the universe!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Ancient Drow 3: PRAISE THE HUNGRY DEEP! PRAISE THE HUNGRY DEEP!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">At that moment, a man walks into the station.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Feldspar: What is going on in here?! Why aren't you guarding the tunnel as I asked?!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Zenoglossss!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Feldspar I presume?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos struggles to stand, her unseeing eyes still glazed over from the assault on her senses and sensibility. She staggers for a moment, but then stiffens in place as her shoulders quake. It begins as a chuckle, but then in a near head-rearing cackle. Her fingers find their way to her face, cradling her cheekbones and smearing themselves in her blood as she grins at nothing.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Oh... I see.... Of course. Of course!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Oh, for him! All for *him*!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos she dances a small twirl as she embraces herself.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: Oh, my dear sweet Karak... For you I shall make your blade sing... and it will be beautiful...!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Feldspar drinks this in, and then turns and bolts.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Ssssssssssssssssssssshit</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Zilvicee take care of Zenoglossss. I shall grab Feldsparrr.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Tollz!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos cackles and points at Feldspar.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: By Ishkrah's love, I do bind thee!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel Bellgivh: Fetch!</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Weave the Web</font><br />
<font color="#660066">HYENA(Tolz)</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Borel Bellgivh Jumps on the back of Tolz as the large Hyena rushes by.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [2d10 = 8]<br />
<font color="#660066">Zenoglos: </font> [d6 = 2]<br />
<font color="#880000">Zenoglos struggles against herself to remove the face of Karak from her mind for a moment to focus on Feldspar. In that moment of realization she seared the Drow's face in her mind and then pleaded to Ishkrah with ever mote of lucidity that remained. In her heart of hearts she could feel the tug and pull of Ishkrah's great design entangle and connect the two. And she prayed with all her being that her beloved's blade would one day meet the neck of his prey.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Zenoglos: AH hahahahaha!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Borel and Tolz race after Feldspar. In the dark tunnel outside, Tolz pauses as his eyes adjust to the darkness. A click can be heard and a bright flash explodes from the center of the tunnel. Tolz yelps in pain as he and Borel are blinded. Tolz charges towards the sound of boots on pavement, using his memory of the twisted and mangled rail tracks to avoid tripping. Tolz leaps forward and knocks the figure to the ground -- or he would, but apparently the sound was merely an apparition. Feldspar has gotten away. But then suddenly Borel and Tolz hear a crash from around the corner of the tunnel. As their eyes regain function, they turn the corner to see Karak sitting atop a pile of cushions atop a raggedy chariot. The chariot is lined with spikes and dangling bits of cloth and mangled wood. Feldspar lies on the ground, writhing in pain from the whip laced around his ankle. The chariot's pullers (all drow) shy away from the body.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Feldspar: Once back in the station, and Feldspar is wrapped up in chains, Karak explains that he got bored and did not like the idea of the ministers being hurt while he sat comfortably at home. Luckily, this chariot and the chariot team happened to pass by the drug den at the perfect time and Karak decided to just jump on the opportunity. And good thing he did!</font><br />
